# 📊 Module 6: Software Engineering Project Management

This module is titled **Software Engineering Project Management**, it is part of the ***University of Essex, Post Graduate Computer Science Degree***.

<br/>
<br/>

⚠️**Structure Note**: The descriptions of units, unit activities, and unit assignments are included in their own pages, as they can get quite long and I would like to keep the main pages as clean as possible for clarity.
