# ✨ Module 0: Induction

I'm calling this induction module 0 because it was more of an introductory course. It is titled "Induction Computing". It is the induction module in the _University of Essex, Post Graduate Computer Science Degree_.

This induction module was an introduction to what the course would look like, including requirements and expectations. There was also a very, very lengthy introduction to academic integrity and proper referencing using UoEO's Harvard referencing style.

As part of the induction, we were to write a 750 word essay on the topic of "Discuss the importance of a postgraduate degree in the Computer Science field", which is included in the _module0_ folder as docx, or as ✨markdown✨ from the page in the TOC below.
