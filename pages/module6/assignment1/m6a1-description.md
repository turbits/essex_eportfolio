# Unit 6: Assignment 1: Project Report Description

In this unit, the focus is on the first objective/deliverable, the project report. This assignment has two component parts, the team submission and your individual peer assessment. All components must be submitted by end of Unit 6. This accounts for 20% of your final module mark. Only one submission is required from each team with a limit of 2 pages. Nominate one member of your team to submit on the team's behalf. The word count is 1,000 words.

## Full Brief
You are provided with a transcript between two (hypothetical) characters in [chapter 2 of the case study](https://www.my-course.co.uk/pluginfile.php/1031570/mod_assign/intro/2.%20SEPM%202023%20Case%20Study.pdf) and [Appendix 1](https://www.my-course.co.uk/pluginfile.php/1031570/mod_assign/intro/3.%20Appendix%201%20HW%20BOM%20SEPMv2.xlsx) and [2](https://www.my-course.co.uk/pluginfile.php/1031570/mod_assign/intro/4.%20Appendix%202%20SW%20BOM%20SEPMv2.xlsx). You are required to analyse the transcript and extract the initial requirements of both stakeholders and critique them with respect to assumptions and gaps in what is provided.

Based on the information supplied in the provided case study, your tasks are as follows.

You (your group) are required to produce a proposal that details a suitable development methodology (e.g. waterfall or agile based) for the system under consideration, supported by a discussion that justifies the choice of methodology. You should also produce a set of requirements (derived from the supplied discussion transcript), a development plan with suitable milestones, proposed deliverables and an estimated cost of the system (based on the supplied BOMs and the miscellaneous information provided below).

## Checklist
Each deliverable for this assessment is mentioned below and is equally distributed across 3 grading criteria (see Module Resources for the full list):

1. Specify a design approach/methodology that should be used to create the system discussed above, with justification for your selection. (Knowledge and Understanding, 25%).
2. Create a table that lists the requirements you have gathered from the exchange above. What requirements do you think are missing? Explicitly state the assumptions you need to make to be able to design the project plan.
3. Select the key requirements from the list. Create a number of Gherkin specifications that express the exact specifications in terms of Gherkin statements – you should create at least TEN statements. (Application of Knowledge, 25%).
4. Create a fully costed project plan for the system you have designed - this plan should detail the cost price of a single system, when the first prototypes will be ready, when models will be available for sale and when you expect to be generating income. Your budget is £500,000 and you cannot go above this until you have generated income from the sale of the machines. Your other main constraints are: 2,000 machines have been purchased by EDC; the agreed cost price; Syn expects the machines to be ready for sale by January 1984 at the latest (i.e. approximately 13 months maximum time line for the plan).(Application of Knowledge, 25%).
5. The plan should include design times, build times and testing times for both software and hardware. You, as the project manager, will need to decide how much testing time each stage requires, with justifications. Bear in mind you will need to account for unit testing, integration testing, system testing and user acceptance testing at the very least.
6. You are also expected to determine the sell price of the completed machine. (Criticality, 25%).
7. Ensure that you produce a business-ready proposal, that is well structured with no typographical errors. It should be well structured and present your recommendations in a clear and easy to read format. It should have been proofread before it is submitted (Structure and Presentation, 25%).
8. Finally, ensure your justifications for decisions made are based on good academic principles and that any academic sources you have used/referred to are clearly cited and that your references are presented in the required UoEO format.

Please Note: Appendices should not be used to extend the core report as reports should stand alone and be complete and concise, without the appendices. They should really only be used if required, and only for supplementary and/or supporting information. One key part of the exercises in this module is the need to be to be able to express ideas succinctly, concisely and with necessary brevity.

## Learning Outcomes
- Identify and apply appropriate software engineering and project management methodologies, tools and techniques for the development of solutions to real-world problems.
- Explore the implications of computer and network architectures for system-level design and development, as appropriate for risk and quality management.
- Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real-life perspectives on roles and team organisation.

## Turnitin Originality Check
Before submitting your assignment, it is important to check the originality of your work by submitting your assignment to Turnitin.

By submitting your assignment to this tool you will receive an originality report which can be used to check that you have not included other authors' work without correct citation. It is important to note that submitting your work to the Turnitin Originality Check tool does not count as a submission of your final work. You must still submit your assignment below.

## Academic Integrity and Plagiarism
We take academic integrity very seriously. Academic integrity means acting with fairness and honesty, giving credit to others where you are referring to their ideas or research and respecting the work of others. Plagiarism is defined as: 'Using or copying the work of others (whether written, printed or in any other form) without proper acknowledgement'. Before you finalise your assignment take time to check that all your statements are backed up with supporting evidence, that all sources you use - whether referring to their ideas, quoting directly or paraphrasing - are correctly referenced in the text. Correct use of referencing acknowledges the academic whose work has informed yours, enables the reader to find the sources you have used, and demonstrates your ability to find and analyse relevant information. 

Failure to properly acknowledge the work of others is an academic offense and may result in your work incurring a penalty or, in the most serious cases, you being removed from the course for academic dishonesty.

If you are unsure about referencing or plagiarism there are useful resources available in the Study Skills Hub which is accessible from the menu on the left hand side. If you are still experiencing difficulties with academic integrity then you can contact the Study Skills Team for individualised support. 

Please note, a word count penalty applies to this assessment.

If your assessment exceeds the word count limit or range by more than 10% then your awarded grade will be reduced by 10% grade points. For more information please see your student handbook.

Not meeting the word count

There is no grade reduction applied if your assignment does not meet the word count range or limit, but to maximise your opportunity to achieve the highest grade possible, you should aim to meet the word count or range as closely as possible.
