This unit had us do an eportfolio activity on "reflection on software quality", requiring reading of the article "Factors in Software Quality, Volume 1, Concepts and Definitions of Software Quality" by McCall, A., et al. (1977), finding and reading a second more recent article on software quality, then discuss the major differences in relation to software quality between the two articles.

There was also a seminar on code quality in this unit.
