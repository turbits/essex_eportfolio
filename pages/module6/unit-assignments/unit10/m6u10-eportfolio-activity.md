# Unit 10: ePortfolio Activity - Reflection on Software Quality

> Reflection on Software Quality. Review the article by McCall, Richards & Walters (1977).  Select a timelier academic article on software quality. Discuss, in 300 words, the major differences in relation to software quality between the two articles.

This article represents the introduction of "McCall's model", an eleven-point software quality model that was developed by McCall, Richards, and Walters in 1977. The eleven points are:
- Correctness
- Reliability
- Efficiency
- Integrity
- Usability
- Maintainability
- Flexibility
- Testability
- Portability
- Reusability
- Interoperability

The word "article" is used here in the sense of "an item" I believe, as this is a report nearly 200 pages in length, and only comprises volume 1, of which I'm assuming there are several. The report is an extremely detailed and thorough analysis and discussion of the establishment of a software quality model, and is, understandably, a very difficult read.

In 1977, the primary methodology of software development was the waterfall model, a linear and sequential approach to software development. Today, the primary methodology of software development is the agile model, an iterative and incremental approach to software development. The waterfall model is still widely used, but is not as popular as it once was. The agile model is more popular because it allows for more flexibility and adaptability, which is important in today's fast-paced world. I found it difficult to find a singular article that directly comments on software quality in the modern era, and so have included an analytical comparitive study article.

In the article "Quality Models in Software Engineering Literature: An Analytical and Comparitive Study" by Rafa E. Al-Qutaish (2010) published in the Journal of American Science, Al-Qutaish posits that McCall's model is subjective, "the quality is subjectively measured based on the judgment on the person(s) answering the questions[...]" (Al-Qutaish, 2010), and implies that it is incomplete (as are Boehm's, Doromey's, and FURPS), saying that these models "are neither clearly nor completely defined and connected to the upper level of the quality models" (Al-Qutaish, 2010). He provides an example in the McCall model, saying that "the metrics should be clearly and completely defined and connected to the corresponding quality criteria", referring to the sub-characteristics of the model's top-level characteristics.

Al-Qutaish also says that the ISO-9126-1 quality model, a software quality model created in 1991 by the International Organization for Standards, a global federation of national standards bodies, "is the most useful one since it has been build based on an international consensus and agreement from all the country members of the ISO organization" (Al-Qutaish, 2010). The ISO-9126-1 model has been superseded by the ISO/IEC-25010:2011 model, the current ISO standard for software quality, published in 2011. ISO/IEC-25010:2011 is one of the most widely used software quality models in use today[1][2][3].

According to the ISO website, ISO/IEC-25010:2011 will be superseded by ISO/IEC PRF 25002 (ISO, 2023), ISO/IEC 25010:2023, and ISO/IEC 25019:2023. 25010 and 25019 are currently published, with 25002 in development.
