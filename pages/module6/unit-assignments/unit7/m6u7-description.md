# Unit 7: Description

Welcome to Week 7, where we will examine the role that is played by software development life cycles (SDLC) in influencing the way in which a project is managed, considering, more specifically, the waterfall and agile approaches to project management. We will then look at the specific tasks involved in each stage of a life cycle in more detail, highlighting the ways in which the Project Manager supports the activities involved. 

**In this unit we shall:**
- Examine the importance of managing a project so that the triple constraints of project management are balanced against one another.
- Gain an appreciation of the variety of non-functional requirements. 
- Investigate a selection of mistakes which are made during software engineering projects.

**On completion of this unit you will be able to:**
- Describe the activities that are carried out by a Project Manager at each stage of the SDLC. 
- Collect the requirements of a software engineering project using the Volere template.
- Define a behaviour-driven development scenario.

## Formative Activities

- **Participate in Collaborative Discussion 2,** continuing the discussion started in unit 5. This week, you will need to provide a summary of the discussion based on your initial post and the feedback from your peers. This is your `Summary` post. Agree or otherwise, with reasons, with the contributions and reviews made by other students on the topic under discussion, enhancing your original post. This should be 300 words (excluding references).
- **This summary post is a required component of your e-portfolio** and provides evidence of your personal growth. You will be submitting the e-portfolio for this module at the end of week 12 as the final summative assessment of the module.\
- Prepare for next week’s seminar session by reviewing the seminar tasks in Unit 8.
- e-Portfolio Activity: Data Structures Reflection
- Read Dicheva & Hodge (2018). Think about an online system which you use on a daily basis. Consider how it might operate at the back-end using data structures. This will inform our discussion during next week’s seminar.
