- [Unit 4 - Collaborative Discussion: Summary Post](/pages/module6/unit-assignments/unit4/collab-discussion.html)

This unit had us complete a summary post for the part 1 collaborative discussions set. Unfortunately, as of October 23, 2023, at approximately 20:00 BST/14:00 UTC-7, the summary post forums error when attempting to access them, preventing me from posting my summary. I have included the summary post and documentation of the error, accessible from the above TOC. Ironic, considering the topic of the discussions (software project failures). :^)
