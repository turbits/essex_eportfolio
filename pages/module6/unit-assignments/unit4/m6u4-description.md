# Unit 4: Description

Welcome to Week 4 where we will discuss common risks and risk mitigation in large software projects. In addition, we will utilise some of the tools discussed in the previous lecture cast to create a project estimate.

**In this unit we shall:**
- Discuss risks and risk mitigation in large software projects.
- Produce an estimate for our summative project utilising the tools reviewed.
- Review a number of estimating tools.

**On completion of this unit you will be able to:**
- Select an appropriate tool for project estimation based on a number of common factors
- Utilise the tool to create a project estimate.
- Evaluate the usefulness of the tool in estimating.
- Discuss risk evaluation and mitigation approaches.

## Formative Activities

**Collaborative Learning Discussion 1 (continued).** Participate in Collaborative Discussion 1, continuing the discussion started in unit 2. This week, provide a summary of the discussion based on your initial post and the feedback from your peers. This is your 'Summary' post. Agree or otherwise, with reasons, with the contributions and reviews made by other students on the topic under discussion, enhancing your original post. This should be 300 words (excluding references). This summary post is a required component of your e-portfolio and provides evidence of your personal growth. You will be submitting the e-portfolio for this module at the end of week 12 as the final summative assessment of the module.

Wiki Entry: Risks and risk mitigation. Read the articles by Verner et al (2014) and Anton & Nucu (2020) and then answer the following questions:

1. What are the main risks that the authors identify? How do these fit into the traditional SDLC model?
2. Which of the frameworks discussed in the Unit 3 lecturecast would you use to capture and categorise the risks?
3. Add a risk and a suggested mitigation to the module wiki.
4. Choose an entry made by one of your colleagues in the wiki and comment on how you might mitigate it.
