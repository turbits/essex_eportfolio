# Unit 5: Collaborative Discussion Part 2: Description

This discussion will last for 3 weeks covering units 5, 7 and 8. (Not unit 6!)  Ensure you include appropriate citations and references in all your posts (this is not included in the word count for each week's post/submission).

Collaborative Learning Discussion 2: Scanning Exercise and Results
Human emotions can affect the user experience, a fact which contributes to the complexity of user satisfaction with a product. Further complicating the process is the fact that user emotions on the first use of a product are likely to be different to their emotions once they become more experienced. 

- Read Minge & Thuring (2018). Based on the change in human emotion over time, might you adapt Figure 1 in their paper in any way?

**Learning Outcomes**
- Design, develop and evaluate management systems to produce solutions that handle constraints and uncertainty, contextualising BDD concepts and secure coding principles & practices in SDLC.
- Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real-life perspectives on roles and team organisation.

**Assignment Guidance**
- Your initial posting should respond to the question and be at least 200 words long.  This should be labelled as 'Initial Post'
- You will then respond to at least 2 of your peers' posts in unit 2 (each labelled as 'Peer Response').  To guide your responses, look at the guidelines for the peer review process on the Department’s homepage. Focus on the possible measures that could have been put in place in order to prevent the incidents highlighted by your peers.  Please try to limit your response posts to 200-300 words maximum, so that others may be encouraged to reflect on, and respond to your ideas. 
- In Unit 3, you should provide a summary post based on your initial post, the feedback from your peers and the content of the three units. Please label this as ‘Summary Post’. It should be 300 words.
- Referencing: When you have referred to other authors thoughts, ideas and opinions in your posts, you must reference the author as you would in an academic assignment using the UoEO Harvard reference style.
- You will be not be assessed on your contribution to this forum throughout the module, but the tutor will post group feedback via a module announcement.
- This activity forms a component of your e-portfolio which you will submit in unit 12. All e-portfolio activities are intended to demonstrate your ability and strengths through evidence and reflection.
