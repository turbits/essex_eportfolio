# Unit 9 - ePortfolio Activity: Improving Code Quality

This activity had us implement "at least 3" of the srategies presented in the Writing Clean and Pythonic Code seminar by James Mertz (Mertz, 2019). The presentation included (summed up) the following strategies:
- Use tools to help you
    - IDEs
        - PyCharm
        - VS Code
    - Linters
        - PyLint
    - Formatters
        - black.py
- Properly structure your project
    - Notebook structure
    - One off script structure
    - Package structure
- Follow a style guide
    - PEP8
- Document all the things
    - Comments & docstrings
    - Project documentation
    - Documentation Generators
        - Sphinx

I will be using my "autonomous vehicle system" project from a previous course in this program, Object Oriented Programming, way back in module 2, almost a year ago! Back then, we were required to use a platform called "codio", which is a web-based IDE. This time around, I will be using the JetBrain's PyCharm IDE, a fully featured and python-focused IDE.
