# Unit 9: Description

Welcome to Week 9. This week is important as it will help you to appreciate the range of ways through which software quality may be determined to have been achieved. When testing a software development and preparing for delivery of the software to the client, there will be a need to demonstrate that the functional and non-functional requirements of the system have been fulfilled. 

**In this unit we shall:**
- Examine the reasons for which effective quality management of a software development is important.
- Explore a variety of metrics by which software quality may be measured.
- Recognise the important roles to be played by quality management planning, control and assurance when working to provision a high-quality software product.

**On completion of this unit you will be able to:**
- Write a set of non-functional requirements by which a software development may be tested to demonstrate that quality has been achieved.
- Appreciate the ways in which technical debt may be accrued through ineffective software quality management.

## Formative activities
- e-Portfolio Activity: Improving Code Quality. Refer to the Mertz (2019) resource.  Use some Python code which you have developed in the past and apply at least 3 of the strategies presented at the source to improve its quality. You can use the Jupyter Notebook workspace in Codio and save your work to your GitHub repository.
