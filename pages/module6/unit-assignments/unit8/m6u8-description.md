# Unit 8: Description

Welcome to Week 8 where we will carry out some research into state-of-the-art in connected technologies, with a view to identifying the types of data which they might produce and consume. We will then consider how this data might be stored from a more practical perspective so that it may be used electronically through investigating data structure storage in Python. 

**In this unit we shall:**
- Select an article from a reputable online IT-related magazine on connected technology. 
- Review the data structures which are available in Python to support the retention of data electronically. 
- Perform an implementation of the data structures that you have identified in Python. 

**On completion of this unit you will be able to:**
- Identify the most appropriate data structure to retain different attributes of data. 
- Use Python’s built-in capabilities to practically retain data electronically

## Formative Activities

- Post any additional sources of information that you have used to support your work for the seminar tasks to the module wiki.
- Remember to update your e-portfolio with your thoughts, outcomes from the seminar and your team discussions.
