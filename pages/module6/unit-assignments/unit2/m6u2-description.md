# Unit 2: Description

Welcome to Week 2, in which we will study important aspects of project management – namely why projects fail and how to elicit requirements and the best way to action them.  

**In this unit we shall:**
- Read a number of articles about large projects failing.
- Investigate the reasons for failure.
- Discuss suitable mitigations.
- Practice requirements gathering using the Gherkin tool.

**On completion of this unit you will be able to:**
- Suggest mitigations for common project failures.
- Carry out requirements gathering using Gherkin.


## Formative activities
- Collaborative Learning Discussion 1 (continued).
- Review and respond to the discussion in unit 1. You should respond to at least two of your peers' contributions by selecting two examples of project failures from your colleagues and add your comments about possible causes and mitigations. 
- Please try to limit your posts to 200-300 words maximum, so that others may be encouraged to reflect on, and respond to your ideas. Your follow-up responses should be labelled as 'Peer Response'. 
- Be prepared to discuss your post and thoughts during this week's seminar.
