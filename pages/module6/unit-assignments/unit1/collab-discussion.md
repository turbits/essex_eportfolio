# Unit 1 - Collaborative Discussion Part 1

## Discussion Topic: Project Failures Study
Please read the Lehtinen et al. (2014) paper and then answer the following questions:

-Question 1: What do you believe are the three most common reasons for project failure?
- Question 2: Give two examples of failures that support your choices (there are several examples in the lecturecast).

## My Initial Post

### Causes of Project Failure

**1. Bridge causes.** Considering I have not worked in project management, I would have to defer to Lehtinen et al., on the main cause of failed projects, accounting for a whopping 50% of all failures, is bridge causes. As the article puts it, "Lack of cooperation, weak task backlog, and lack of software testing resources were common bridge causes" (Lehtinen et al., 2014).

**2. Task management Software.** In my experience with performing work under a project and project manager, I would say that the main cause would be weak task management software or none at all. A solid foundation for any project, in my opinion, is a dynamic task board that can represent tasks (in kanban-style, for example), that can also represent tasks in a timeline or as grouped lists. GitHub Issues (GitHub, n.d.) is a good example of this functionality.

**3. Lack of cross-skillset experience.** Planning a software project takes, in my experience and opinion, a somewhat generalists mind to be able to connect and communicate properly with all teams and stakeholders involved in the project. Conveying concepts from the software team to the executive team is an acquired skill through application to understand the core common concepts of software development, and one that I believe is a major cause of software project failure.

###  Examples of Failures

**Healthcare.gov (2013).** In 2011 development began on Healthcare.gov, the website that would be used in the U.S. for citizens to sign up to the Affordable Care Act. The project was a failure, and the website was not ready for launch. There were many issues with the project, such as fractured management, separation of teams and lack of communication, and a lack of testing. IN 2013 it released as a broken project, with issues that spanned across teams. The resolution was to centralize project management, reforming the development team to include more experienced skillsets, and daily 'scrums' - meetings where the team would discuss the project, triage risks, and prioritize tasks based on urgency. (Dolfing, 2023)

**Queensland Medical Payroll System (2010).** Tony Moore of the Sydney Morning Herald wrote of the premiere of Queensland at the time, Campbell Newman, saying "It could be the worst failure of public administration in this nation". (Moore, T., 2013). Queensland needed a modern-day updating of their payroll system, as current systems were untenable, nearing 40,000 emails and some 15,000 corrections needing to be made each week. IBM became involved, and through various project management failures, including under-evaluation and lack of communication, as well as a fair bit of nepotism. The 6.19 million AUD project ended up costing taxpayers 1.2 billion AUD, and has had issues since its launch. (Moore, T., 2013).
