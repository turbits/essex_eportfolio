# Unit 6: Assignment 3: ePortfolio Description

The final assessment in this module is an individual e-portfolio that collates all the evidence of your work in this module. It accounts for 40% of the overall module mark. The word count is 2,500 words. Submit by end of Unit 12.

## Assignment Details
This assessment focuses on your reflections on being part of a development team and your individual contributions throughout this module, as well as your evaluation of your team's work in units 6 and 11. You will also need to include screenshots (or similar) of your individual contributions to the team projects - these are not applied to your word count for this submission. Please note that your reflections are not seen by other students, so you are free to discuss what is relevant to your learning and the processes you have gone through.

You have the option of presenting this as a video recording (with subtitles) or as written text. In creating the content, some people find a diary style approach helps. For example, you can use Rolfe et al.’s (2001) approach. You could start by providing a brief description of the project outcomes or critical incident (WHAT), analyse and interpret the information (SO WHAT) and then decide how you can use the information and learning from it (NOW WHAT). You can find out more about the structure of your reflection by visiting the e-portfolio page on the department site.  

If submitting a video, remember that you it need to include comprehensive subtitles (in English). The video recording can consist of a series of video logs recorded during the module, edited together to form a comprehensive video diary for final submission. Remember that this must flow as an integrated, comprehensive record of your experience on the module. If you choose to use a video format, you must also provide a transcript file and upload this into the submission portal below.

These are some exploratory questions from the grading criteria to help you develop your reflection:
- Have you clearly described the topic of your project and the various aspects of project which are key to your reflection? (Application of Knowledge, 20%).
- Emotional Response and Analysis. Critically analyse yourself and your own behaviour during this project.  How did working on the project make you feel?  How did these emotions affect you and your work?  Have you reviewed the views of others, your prior experience, and correctly referenced literature, in relation to your current behaviour and the work you’ve done? (Application of Knowledge, 20% and Criticality, 40%).
- Learning and Changed Actions. Show that you have thought deeply about what exactly produced your learning (or a new way of thinking) while taking this project. (Application of Knowledge, 20% and Criticality, 40%).
- Do you have evidence of skills and knowledge developed through this project?  Provide a clear description of your evidence of learning during this project and how you can apply (or have applied) them in a real-world experience. (Application of Knowledge, 20% and Criticality, 40%).
- You will need to evidence and evaluate your individual contribution to a group project and the completion of tasks to the required standard. You will also need to demonstrate clear participation in the team activities as it informs your reflection. Legible screenshots from your e-portfolio are acceptable and will not affect your word count. (Collaboration, 20%).
- Is there an accurate use of citations and references throughout this piece of work? Have you demonstrated the required integrity in your submission? (Academic Integrity, 10%).

The emphasis here is not on the look and feel of your reflection. The content of your reflection must be well organised, communicating your thoughts in a clear and concise manner, taking into account any requirements from the assessment guidance. Your work should have minimal errors in spelling, grammar, and punctuation. (Structure and Presentation, 10%)

It is expected that reflections will be written as you progress through the module, as listed above. The final reflective piece that you prepare, which might include components of the reflections that you have captured throughout the module is the piece which should be capped at the given word limit.

## Turnitin Originality Check
Before submitting your assignment, it is important to check the originality of your work by submitting your assignment to Turnitin.

By submitting your assignment to this tool you will receive an originality report which can be used to check that you have not included other authors work without correct citation. It is important to note that submitting your work to the Turnitin Originality Check tool does not count as a submission of your final work. You must still submit your assignment below.

## Academic Integrity and Plagiarism
We take academic integrity very seriously. Academic integrity means acting with fairness and honesty, giving credit to others where you are referring to their ideas or research and respecting the work of others. Plagiarism is defined as: 'Using or copying the work of others (whether written, printed or in any other form) without proper acknowledgement'. Before you finalise your assignment take time to check that all your statements are backed up with supporting evidence, that all sources you use - whether referring to their ideas, quoting directly or paraphrasing - are correctly referenced in the text. Correct use of referencing acknowledges the academic whose work has informed yours, enables the reader to find the sources you have used and demonstrates your ability to find and analyse relevant information. 

Failure to properly acknowledge the work of others is an academic offence and may result in your work incurring a penalty or, in the most serious cases, you being removed from the course for academic dishonesty.

If you are unsure about referencing or plagiarism there are useful resources available in the Study Skills Hub which is accessible from the menu on the left hand side. If you are still experiencing difficulties with academic integrity then you can contact the Study Skills Team for individualised support.

Please note, a word count penalty applies to this assessment.

If your assessment exceeds the word count limit or range by more than 10% then your awarded grade will be reduced by 10% grade points. For more information please see your student handbook.

Not meeting the word count

There is no grade reduction applied if your assignment does not meet the word count range or limit, but to maximise your opportunity to achieve the highest grade possible, you should aim to meet the word count or range as closely as possible.
