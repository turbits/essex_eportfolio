This assignment page starts with saying this:

> The final assessment in this module is an individual e-portfolio that collates all the evidence of your work in this module. It accounts for 40% of the overall module mark. The word count is 2,500 words. Submit by end of Unit 12.

This is worded a bit odd, I think. This ePortfolio and the pieces (collab, code, reflections, references, etc.) are all, most likely, far beyond 2,500 words. Regardless, I will include a ~1,000 word reflective piece (see table of contents) as I haven't really reflected in the units. For the ePortfolio and collaboration pieces, code, etc., all of that is included in this repository (or linked where appropriate) and in the website: [https://essex.trevorwoodman.ca](https://essex.trevorwoodman.ca).

👉***A very important thing*** that I would like to note is that I **do not** update the ePortfolio repo or website after final submission, until the next module begins. This can be verified against the latest commit on the repository: [https://github.com/turbits/essex_eportfolio](https://github.com/turbits/essex_eportfolio). I guess, theoretically, I could update the website without updating the github repo, but I am promising that I **do not** and **will not**, and this could be cross-referenced regardless.

See above table of contents for links to the reflective piece (both markdown and docx), and the ePortfolio repository.
