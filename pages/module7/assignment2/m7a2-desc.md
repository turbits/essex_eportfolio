*Copied from the [Assignment page](https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=943412) on 05 Mar 2024.*

This summative assessment accounts for 40% of your final module grade. Submit by end of unit 6. The required word count for your submission is 1200 words.

## Assignment Brief
Cathy is not convinced by your report and has asked you to create a python application that allows her to both visualise the attack tree/ graph AND to add values to the nodes which the application will aggregate to form an overall value impact to the business of any of the threats identified. This serves as an unconventional executive summary for the company. Note that the associated grading criteria are highlighted in the requirements below, to be reviewed alongside the criteria grid (Module Resources).

Checklist for your Executive Summary and Presentation:

Creation (Knowledge and Understanding weighted at 20%, Use of Relevant Sources weighted at 20%)

1. Create a Python Application that can accept an attack tree specification (in an industry-standard format such as XML, YAML, or JSON) and produce a graphical representation of the attack tree. 
2. The user should be able to add values (as monetary amounts or probabilities) to the leaf nodes. 
3. The application should be able to aggregate these values into an overall threat assessment rating – that may be a monetary value or a probability of attack success.
4. Use your application to demonstrate the threat model of both the original system (pre-digitalisation) and the system after your recommended digitalisation steps have been applied.

You should submit your code in a zip file together with screenshots showing the operation, test outputs, and linter evaluation reports (if available). The code should include extensive comments explaining how it works and why coding decisions were made. You should reference all external libraries, code, and code snippets you have used. (Knowledge and Understanding weighted at 10%, Criticality weighted at 30%)

1. You should include a readme file that explains how the code should be installed and run, along with your reference list and any general comments about the code and application design.
2. Be prepared to demonstrate your code toyour tutor in one-to-one sessions in seminars and/ or office slots.

Presentation and Structure of your findings (weighted at 10%) includes spelling, code quality organisation, as well as evidence of proofreading. You will also be assessed on the correct use (and format) of citations and references in your work (Academic Integrity weighted at 10%).

**Please also note that appendices should not be used to extend the core report** as reports should stand alone, complete and concise, without the appendices. They should really only be used if required, and only for supplementary and/ or supporting information. **One key part of the exercises in this module is the need to be to be able to express ideas succinctly, concisely and with necessary brevity.**

## Learning Outcomes
- Identify and analyse security risks, threats and vulnerabilities in information systems and determine appropriate methodologies, tools, and techniques to manage and/or solve them.
- Gather and synthesise information from multiple sources (including internet security alerts & warning sites) to aid in the systematic analysis of security breaches & issues.
- Critically appraise and utilise methodologies, tools and techniques that help manage and audit security issues.
- Articulate the legal, social, ethical, and professional issues faced by information security professionals.
