# Collaborative Discussion Unit 1 - Part 1: The Risks of Digitalisation

## Assignment Description

Based on your reading of the case study listed above (Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, 2019) answer the following questions in the discussion forum:
- What do the authors mean by the term ‘Industry 4.0’ - give two examples.
- Give two real-world examples of risks that fit into the authors categories.
- Find another journal article that either supports or contradicts the points made in the cited study.


- Your initial posting should respond to the question and be at least 200 words long.  This should be labelled as 'Initial Post'
- You will then respond to at least 2 of your peers' posts in unit 2 (each labelled as 'Peer Response'). To guide your responses, look at the guidelines for the peer review process on the Department’s homepage. Focus on the possible measures that could have been put in place in order to prevent the incidents highlighted by your peers. Please try to limit your response posts to 200-300 words maximum, so that others may be encouraged to reflect on, and respond to your ideas.
- Referencing: When you have referred to other authors thoughts, ideas and opinions in your posts, you must reference the author as you would in an academic assignment using the UoEO Harvard reference style.
- You will not be assessed on your contribution to this forum throughout the module, but the tutor will post group feedback via a module announcement.
- This activity forms a component of your e-portfolio which you should continue to build throughout your programme. All e-portfolio activities are intended to demonstrate your ability and strengths through evidence and reflection.

## Assignment Submission

### Initial Post
In the article of this case study, Risks of Digitalisation of Business Models by Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019), the authors describe a term called "Industry 4.0". The authors use this term and paraphrase from several other authors to describe it as Internet of Things (IoT), big data, cloud computing, robotics, artifical intelligence, and decentralisation of communications between people and machines (Schwab, et al 2018; L. D. Xu, et al 2018; Roblek et al, 2016). It also outlines the additive concerns to risk management, including the value of data, cybersecurity, the criticality of a function and scalability of failure, misuse of ownership, and cost of mistakes (Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, 2019).
