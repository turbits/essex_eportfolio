# Assignment 3: Individual Reflection - Description

*Copied from the [Assignment page](https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=943413) on 06 Mar 2024.*

Submit by end of unit 6. This assignment counts for 30% of the total module mark. The word count for this reflection is 800 words (not including diagrams, charts and illustrations). This also applies to your transcript, if applicable.

## Assignment Details

It is expected that reflections will be written as you progress through the module, as listed above. The final reflective piece that you prepare, which might include components of the reflections that you have captured throughout the module is the piece which should be capped at the given word limit.

You have the option of presenting your reflective piece as a video recording (with subtitles) or as written text. In writing the reflective content, some people find a diary-style approach helps. For example, you can use Rolfe et al.’s (2001) approach. You could start by providing a brief description of the project outcomes or critical incident (WHAT), analyse and interpret the information (SO WHAT) and then decide how you can use the information and learning from it (NOW WHAT). You can find out more about the structure of your reflection by visiting the e-portfolio page on the department site. Please note that your reflections are not seen by other students, so you are free to discuss what is relevant to your learning and the processes you have gone through.

If submitting a video reflection, remember that you will need to include comprehensive subtitles (in English). The video recording can consist of a series of video-logs recorded during the module, edited together to form a comprehensive video diary for final submission. Remember that this must flow as an integrated, comprehensive record of your experience on the module. If you choose to use a video format, you must also provide a transcript file and upload this into the submission portal below.

These are some exploratory questions from the grading criteria to help you develop your reflection:
- Have you clearly described the topic of your project and the various aspects of project which are key to your reflection? (Knowledge and understanding weighted at 20%)
- Emotional Response and Analysis. Critically analyse yourself and your own behaviour during this project. How did working on the project make you feel? How did these emotions affect you and your work? Have you reviewed the views of others, your prior experience, and correctly referenced literature, in relation to your current behaviour and the work you’ve done? (Application of Knowledge weighted at 10%, Criticality weighted at 10%)
- Learning and Changed Actions. Show that you have thought deeply about what exactly produced your learning (or a new way of thinking) while taking this project. (Application of Knowledge weighted at 10%, Criticality weighted at 10%)
- Do you have evidence of skills and knowledge developed through this project? Provide a clear description of your evidence of learning during this project and how you can apply (or have applied) them in a real-world experience. (Application of Knowledge weighted at 5%, Criticality weighted at 5%)
- You will need to evidence and evaluate your individual contribution to a group project, completing tasks to the required standard. You will also need to demonstrate clear participation in the team activities as it informs your reflection. Legible screenshots from your e-portfolio are acceptable and will not affect your word count. (Collaboration weighted at 25%)
- Is there an accurate use of citations and references throughout this piece of work? Have you demonstrated the required integrity in your submission? (Academic Integrity weighted at 10%)

The emphasis here is not on the look and feel of your reflection. The content of your reflection must be well organised, communicating your thoughts in a clear and concise manner, taking into account any requirements from the assessment guidance. Your work should have minimal errors in spelling, grammar and punctuation. (Structure and Presentation weighted at 5%)
