# Assignment 3: Individual Reflection - Reflective Piece

My time during the Information Security Management course has strengthened my understanding of the importance of security in the digital age, and the need for a comprehensive and standardized approach to information security and risk management. This reflective piece will outline my time during the course, my comprehension of the course material, and the impact of the course on my professional development.

The course began with a focus on the importance of risk management and analysis, having us complete a risk identification report for a fictional company that was planning a digital transformation of their business. The process of researching and producing the report was very informational for me from a professional standpoint. I am able to apply the knowledge I gained from the course to my current role, and I will now be able to apply the knowledge to future roles as well. The risk analysis methodologies, standards, and frameworks that are used in the industry was very beneficial and broadened my understanding of the information security field.

The second assignment was to create a Python application that could accept an attack tree specification and produce a graphical representation of the attack tree. This was a challenging task, as I do not generally use Python except for the university courses as they have all been Python based where a software was a deliverable. I also learned and applied the tkinter GUI library for the first time for this assignment, but it was a great learning experience. I was able to apply the knowledge I gained from the course and research to create a tool that could be used to visualize and assess the impact of threats to a business. Admittedly not a very good software, but I believe it effectively captured the essence of an attack tree visualizer and editor.

While I have not yet applied the skills or knowledge I have gained from the course to a real-world experience as of yet, I am confident that it will come up in my professional career at some point. I believe that I will be better prepared to gather and synthesise information to aid in analysis of systems or information so that I can better secure them and to articulate the legal, social, ethical, and professional concerns.

Working throughout the course has involved a mix of frustration and satisfaction of course given the deliverables. I would say that the primary stressor was the first assignment however, and possibly this reflective piece as well. I would much prefer being in a IDE and writing code to writing an essay or reflective piece. That being said, I am satisfied with the work I have produced and the knowledge I have gained from the course, and it has been a valuable experience.

Academic integrity, and integrity in general, is very important to me, and as far as I am aware I have demonstrated that in my work. I am always honest and forthcoming with sources and reference, even if they are minute, such as a particular line of code that I directly copied from Stackoverflow or someone's post. I have always felt that credit is important, regardless of the size of the contribution.

In conclusion, I have had a positive experience with the information security management course, and I am a better professional for the knowledge and skills I have gained and practiced over these six weeks. I am confident that I will be able to apply the knowledge and skills I have gained from the course to my professional career, and I am grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow. I am looking forward to new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow in the future.
