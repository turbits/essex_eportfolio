# ✍️ Module 5: Research Methods and Professional Practice

This module is titled **Research Methods and Professional Practice**, it is part of the ***University of Essex, Post Graduate Computer Science Degree***.

<br/>
<br/>

⚠️**Structure Change**: For this and future modules, I have decided to move the descriptions of units, unit activities, and unit assignments into their own pages as they can get quite long and I would like to keep the main pages as clean as possible for clarity.

<br/>
