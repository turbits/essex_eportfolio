# Module 5: Assignment 3: End of Module Assignment - Individual ePortfolio

## Table of Contents

Please note: while the branch and export will contain the content for the M5A3 submission, it isn't terribly readable. I don't use GitHub pages, as I self-host, but my ePortfolio is available here: [https://essex.trevorwoodman.ca](https://essex.trevorwoodman.ca). The content on my Essex site is **not modified** until the beginning of another module, so it will be the same as the branch and export as of marking. You can verify this is true by checking when `main` was last updated (which will indicate when I last updated my website).
