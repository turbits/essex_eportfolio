# Module 5: Assignment 3: End of Module Assignment - Individual ePortfolio

## Table of Contents

__*Please note*__: while the GitHub branch will contain the content for the M5A3 submission, it isn't terribly readable. I do not use GitHub pages as I prefer to self-host; my ePortfolio is available here: [https://essex.trevorwoodman.ca](https://essex.trevorwoodman.ca).

The content on my live Essex site is __*not modified*__ from the time it is submitted until the beginning of another module, so it will be the same as the submitted branch at the time of marking. You can verify this is true by checking when `main` was last updated on my [repository](https://github.com/turbits/essex_eportfolio) (which will indicate when I last updated my website).
