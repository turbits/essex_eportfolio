Welcome to Week 1 in which you will be introduced to the Ethics of Research and the Scientific Method.

The first question to answer in this module would be “What is the Purpose of Research?”. Whether you continue in Higher Education or move into industry, it is essential to understand why you carry out research. The 3 main reasons/purposes of research are: to explore (familiarise yourself with a topic/situation), to describe (describe your findings), to explain (answer the question “why?”) (QuestionPro, 2021).

One of the most important approaches in research is the scientific method. See Andersen & Hepburn (2020) for details on the history of this method which involves observation, hypothesis, reasoning and testing. The combination of these elements can vary significantly depending on the discipline of a researcher.

Our focus in this unit is on the types of reasoning used in the scientific method as these are the key approaches for problem-solving. The 2 core types of reasoning are Deductive and Inductive reasoning.

Both deduction and induction are forms of inference, which means reaching a conclusion based on evidence and reasoning. However, as the diagram shows (Miessler, 2020), deduction moves you (the researcher) from an idea to an observation, while induction takes you from an observation to an idea.

Deduction can get you to a perfect conclusion, but only if all your assumptions are 100% correct. Therefore, researchers in a non-lab/scientific setting would find deduction more difficult to use because it is often difficult to find a set of fully agreed-upon facts on which to structure their arguments.

On the other hand, induction is used more frequently to solve everyday problems. It is particularly useful for problems that involve partial information about a situation or activity and the conclusions may not always be right, but they are more practical.

Before delving further into the research process. It is essential to develop an understanding of research ethics. Ethics is an area is of importance when conducting any piece of research, particularly where people may be involved.

>As part of all undergraduate and postgraduate projects, you are required to consider any ethical implications of the proposed research. Ethical approval must be granted before students can collect any data from external sources or undertake primary research with human participants. The latter includes both qualitative research, such as interviews and focus groups as well as quantitative research such as experiments or questionnaire studies. Studies analysing previously existing, secondary data will require ethical approval if the data contains any sensitive or personal identifiable information. You will also require evidence of permission to use secondary data where it is not freely accessible.

So, what are Research Ethics? This can be reviewed by focusing on the key principles that need to be applied when preparing and carrying out your research project, as described by the Menlo Report (Bailey, 2013):
- **Respect**: If you are using individuals, they must take part voluntarily. You must respect their decision to participate or not (gaining their consent). Your participants should also have the right to anonymity.
- **Beneficence**: The balance here is between maximising the benefit you gain from your research and the risk it may pose for the participants.
- **Justice**: This relates to the equal treatment of your participants, as well as the fair distribution of the benefits of the research.
- **Respect for Law and Public Interest**: A researcher should always engage in legal due diligence and be accountable for their actions. Research should be designed, reviewed and undertaken to ensure recognised standards of integrity are met, and quality and transparency are assured.

It is imperative to point out at this point that though both ethics and morals are concerned with ‘right’ and ‘wrong’, they are also quite different. Mitchell (2018) discusses several scenarios in white hat/ethical hacking where they may be in conflict.

Alongside ethics, a researcher must be professional in all areas of their research and practice. A good explanation of what professionalism should mean to you in the various fields of Computer Science is given in the BCS Code of Conduct. This is provided in your reading for this week, as well as information on data protection and intellectual property.
