# Unit 1: Ethics in Computing: Reflective Activity: Description

Read Stahl et al (2016) and Bott (2018) Chapter 1.

In the Stahl et al (2016) paper, the authors state that “many of the authors involved in researching the ethics of computing remain wedded to their disciplinary traditions and fail to provide actionable advice to relevant stakeholders.”

Consider yourself as a relevant stakeholder, a Computing professional working for a company of your choice. Examine how one or more of the ethical issues mentioned affect your role in the company and what actions you would need to/can take. You should justify your stance by also reviewing any papers included in this study or other relevant literature. Your discussion should also highlight the impact your actions would have on applicable legal, social and professional issues. Please note that there is no right or wrong answer here, this exercise is to help you evaluate the legal, social ethical and professional issues that affect computing professionals in industry.

There is no strict word limit here but try to limit your submission to 2/3 pages (approximately 1000 words). You should include this in your e-portfolio, and you can submit it to your tutor for formative feedback. (If you wish to do that, please email them the link to the specific part of your GitHub e-portfolio.)
