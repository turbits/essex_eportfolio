## Topic Choice

This unit is an introduction to the module. We had to choose a topic for the literature review assignment. I chose the topic ***The Impact of Communication Technology on Employee Productivity During Government Mandated Lockdown***, with optional sub-topic of "in your country of choice" being Canada.

For reference, see the docx we were provided for topics to choose from [here](/pages/module5/unit-assignments/unit1/RMPP-Approved-Topics.docx)
