## Overview

This unit is an introduction to the module. We had to choose a topic for the literature review assignment. I chose the topic "Implementing Cyber Security tools and/or techniques in" which had a sub-topic, I chose "Local waste management system", which required me to pick a city of my choosing and I chose Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, Canada. The city prompt was, quote, "based on a city of your choice".

My literature review choice: ***Implementing Cyber Security tools and/or techniques in local waste management system in Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, Canada***
