# Reflective Activity - Ethics in Computing

Authored by Trevor Woodman, June 20th, 2023

As a practicing computing professional currently working for a company, I am acutely aware of ethical issues regarding a host of information-related concerns and how they impact me and my responsibilities. The statement from Stahl et al. (2016), "many of the authors involved in researching the ethics of computing remain wedded to their disciplinary traditions and fail to provide actionable advice to relevant stakeholders" highlights a distinct and prevalent issue in the field both in practice and in research. It could be indifference, incompetence, or simply not having the capacity, but in my opinion one or more of these concerns are the root cause of forward progress in the field of ethics as they relate to the information technology industry. A researcher that is either paid or has the time and drive to dedicate to a research on ethics in various fields obviously has a prime motivator to provide as detailed a report as they wish. A computing professional in the field often has so little time to dedicate to anything outside of work that something like ethics often fall by the wayside, even if the professional is vigilent and applying best practice, the scope of concerns is simply too large to be able to address everything. As I have previously written about, a large majority of companies have IT departments that are severely understaffed (Woodman, 2023), and I believe this is the single most important factor. If there is no capacity to address ethics concerns, then they will continue to be a lesser priority.

A prominent ethical issue and one that is commonly waysided is data privacy and security. The further we reach into the future the more data it seems is collected and stored for whatever reason. As the majority of IT infrastructure continues to accelerate towards a cloud-based provider such as Microsoft Azure, data privacy and security become more of a concern. Where is the data being stored, exactly? Who has access to it? Is it truly secure? These questions and many more are forefront in the minds of responsible computing professionals that interface with any data, regardless if it's on-premises or in the cloud, with concerns growing as the "black box" of cloud-provided infrastructure looms ever greater. Why move to a cloud provider then, if the concern is greater? To address my point from earlier, it is to remove concerns from the IT department, lessen the workload, modernize workflows, and increase efficiency. The cloud is a double-edged sword, but it is an increasingly necessary evil in the modern and hyper-expanding world of information.

Some action items that I believe would be beneficial to computing professionals in the industry, with the caveat of being able to dedicate time and resources, are thus:

1. Ensure Compliance: Familiarising myself with the laws and regulations that apply to my company, if any. For example, I know that the Canadian federal government adheres to the *[Access to Information Act (ATIA)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/a-1/)* and the *[Privacy Act](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/ENG/ACTS/P-21/index.html)*. I know that [Nunavut](https://www.gov.nu.ca/access-information-and-protection-privacy-atipp) and [Yukon Territory](https://laws.yukon.ca/cms/images/LEGISLATION/PRINCIPAL/2018/2018-0009/2018-0009_1.pdf) territorial governments adhere to the *Access to Information and Privacy Protection Act (ATIPP)*. Not all companies are required to adhere to these acts and laws, but it would be considered best practice to align onesself with them, as they outline a number of important considerations.

2. Privacy by Design: This is a concept that would need to be implemented at a base level across the entire organization and would, in practice, probably not be a valid course of action considering the immense change that would be required in an established organization. Thought process and workflows across all departments would need to radically change to accommodate this concept, but to say it would be transformative for privacy and security of information in and out of the organisation would be an understatement. This is an ideal that I believe many companies would like to achieve, but cost effectiveness is a significant barrier. By implementing privacy by design, a company could ensure that data is collected and stored ethically and securely.

3. Privacy Impact Assessments: Again, another intensive concept that would require a significant amount of time and resources, but one that would gradually and consistently improve data privacy and security, in concept. Performing assessments and subsequently actioning items would be a significant undertaking and require discipline and dedication, but the long-term benefits would be substantial. By actively conducting PIAs, I could proactively identify and mitigate ethical concerns before they become problematic.

In conclusion, it is crucial to realize and address ethical concerns in the information technology industry, and I believe that change can only come from the top. If the company's leadership is not entirely on board and pushing for privacy and security of data first, an overworked and understaffed IT department will not be able to make the necessary changes at a fundamental level. Every department in the organization must be committed to the pursuit of ethical workflows and practices to make dramatic change. That being said, it is important that we as computing professionals still take the stand and make decisions and changes when possible to maximize ethical decision making and propagate the idea of ethical computing. Doing so will not only positively impact me, my department, my company, and my clients, but it will also benefit the industry as a whole.
