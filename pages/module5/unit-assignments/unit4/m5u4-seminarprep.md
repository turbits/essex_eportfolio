Title: Case Study - Privacy

Please read the case below and answer the questions. You need to determine the ethical issues involved with this case.

### The Case

Ricardo works for the records department of his local government as a computer records clerk, where he has access to files of property tax records. For a scientific study, a researcher, Beth, has been granted access to the numerical portion ‚Äúbut not the corresponding names‚Äù of some records.

Beth finds some information that she would like to use, but she needs the names and addresses corresponding with certain properties. Beth asks Ricardo to retrieve these names and addresses, so she can contact these people for more information and for permission to do further study.

Now consider, what are the ethical issues involved in deciding which of these options to pursue?
1. If Ricardo is not responsible for determining allowable access, should he release the names and addresses?
2. Suppose Ricardo were responsible for determining allowable access to the files. What ethical issues would be involved in his deciding whether to grant access to Beth?
3. Should Beth be allowed to contact the individuals involved? That is, should the Records department release individuals' names to a researcher? What are the ethical issues for the Records department to consider?
4. Suppose Beth contacts the individuals to ask their permission, and one-third of them respond giving permission, one-third respond denying permission, and one-third do not respond. Beth claims that at least one-half of the individuals are needed to make a valid study. What options are available to Beth?

## Case Study

1. ***"If Ricardo is not responsible for determining allowable access, should he release the names and addresses?"***

No, Ricardo should not release the names and addresses to anyone, including Beth. Names and addresses should never be released without authorization. In Canada, this would be a violation of privacy laws which come with severe repercussions.

2. ***"Suppose Ricardo were responsible for determining allowable access to the files. What ethical issues would be involved in his deciding whether to grant access to Beth?"***

The first response stands; in this particular situation, it is unethical and unlawful to provide access to personally identifiable information (PII), and access should not be granted. In Canada, the tax information of private individuals is protected under the Privacy Act as outlined in the Taxpayer Bill of Rights (Government of Canada, 2023).

3. ***"Should Beth be allowed to contact the individuals involved? That is, should the Records department release individuals' names to a researcher? What are the ethical issues for the Records department to consider?"***

There is nothing further to consider; the previous responses stand. Ethically, this would be a violation of privacy laws, and the Records department would be liable for any damages or lawsuits proceeding the release of PII that is protected under the Canadian Privacy Act.

4. ***"Suppose Beth contacts the individuals to ask their permission, and one-third of them respond giving permission, one-third respond denying permission, and one-third do not respond. Beth claims that at least one-half of the individuals are needed to make a valid study. What options are available to Beth?"***

Beth would have to contact these individuals separately and have them provide their own tax information, at which point if the study group is not large enough, Beth would have to widen their search. As a government employee and in the case of a private individual providing their consent, Ricardo would still be unable to provide personally identifiable information to Beth as the Privacy Act forbids it.
