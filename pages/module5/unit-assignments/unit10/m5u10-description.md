# Unit 10: Research Writing - Unit Description

Welcome to week 10 where you will be introduced to research writing. Research writing is a highly valuable skill for anyone working in a tech-related business as it provides an avenue for communicating technical knowledge.

Understanding research writing will help you with the writing of your final dissertation, as it is a large document, and technical people are less likely to be used to writing so much content. It is also useful for the written presentation of a research proposal and research papers, if you wish to publish your research in peer-reviewed journals or books.

**In this unit we shall:**
- Consider research reporting/writing.
- Consider the various sections in a dissertation and how to approach each of them.

**On completion of this unit you will be able to:**
- Understand how to structure a dissertation and how to prepare yourself for the writing.

This week brings together the work you have done so far on finding your area of research, conducting a literature review around your chosen topic and considering which research methods would be suitable for collecting your data. This culminates in your project proposal.
