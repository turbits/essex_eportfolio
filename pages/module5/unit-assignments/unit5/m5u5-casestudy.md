# Unit 5: Reflective Activity: Case Study: Inappropriate Use of Surveys

-  [Case Study Answer](#case-study-answer)

## Activity Description

In 2018, Cambridge Analytica was in the news in the United Kingdom and the USA (Confessore, 2018) for obtaining and sharing data obtained from millions of Facebook users. They obtained the data through innocuous surveys on Facebook (you may have seen this type of survey and probably participated at times). This is probably the highest profile of surveys used for alternative means and, probably, monetary gains. However, this happens often through various media.

Consider how exactly this happened and why it was used. Find one or two further examples of inappropriate use of surveys and highlight the impact of all these examples from the various ethical, social, legal and professional standpoints that apply.

Record your findings in your e-Portfolio. You can also submit your findings to your tutor for formative feedback.

## Case Study Answer

Another example, approximately three weeks after the Cambridge Analytica scandal and intrinsically tied to the company, was CubeYou. CubeYou similarly used Facebook to collect data from its users and sell the data to third parties for marketing purposes. The survey, "You Are What You Like", was labelled as a personality quiz and marketed as an educational quiz. Unethical practices in this situation included deceptive marketing for data collection purposes, and the sale of the collected data to the political consultation firm Cambridge Analytica (Castillo, 2018).

The social impact of Cambridge Analytica alone has been said to have kicked off the era of privacy, and that's only because of a whistleblower that the world was made aware of just how deep the rabbit hole went. CubeYou, and certainly many other companies are all using the same deceptive or even secret data collection practices, amalgamating everything a person does or sees, looks at, watches, buys, or, questionably, talks about near or on their phone, and selling it all to the highest bidder or using it for certain purposes, such as political marketing.

In CubeYou's situation, if they had been found to have labelled their quiz as academic in nature and not used for business purpose, then it would violate Facebook's policies. At the time, privacy and a healthy level of paranoia about ones own data was looked at as a fringe idea, something that only the paranoid or criminals would be worried about. Whether that itself is a result of conditioning is an open-ended answer and another topic, but since 2018, privacy had briefly become a mainstream topic. CubeYou did not break any specific laws that I am aware of, as privacy and data collection was a grey area at the time. While CubeYou's practices were unethical and unprofessional, the legal consequences were minimal, if any, most likely due to the complexity of data privacy laws and lack of comprehensive ledgislation for social media companies at the time (Lapowsky, 2019).
