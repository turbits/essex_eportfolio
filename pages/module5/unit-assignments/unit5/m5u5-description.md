# Unit 5 Interviews and Survey Methods - Unit Description

Welcome to week 5 where you will be introduced to the use of interviews and survey methods.

Conducting in-depth interviews is one of the most common qualitative research methods. It is a conversational piece, involving only respondent at a time. It provides opportunities for the researcher to get in depth details from the respondent.

A survey is one of the most important quantitative methods of collecting data. There are various types of surveys or polls and they are used to explore opinions, trends, etc. Online surveys are more generally used, with easier accessibility for the target respondents.

These methods are often used in research, but not always well. Often, they are used together to gain further insight into specific area of the investigation.

We will also introduce pre- and post-testing methods which can be used with any of the research methods you have seen. They present a viable “before-and-after” picture of the implementation of a new process or system.

**In this unit we shall:**
- Introduce you to interview methods and survey methods.
- Consider the definitions of population and sample.
- Introduce the concept of pre- and post-testing.

**On completion of this unit you will be able to:**
- Understand how interviews and surveys fit into research and whether either or both of these might be useful for your investigation.
- Understand how pre- and post-testing can be used in research.
