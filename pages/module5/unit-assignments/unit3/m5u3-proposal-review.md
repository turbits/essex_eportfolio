# Unit 3 ePortfolio Activity: Research Proposal Review

Considering your thoughts on your chosen area of interest for your project:

>Q1: Which of the methods described in this week's reading would you think would suit your purpose?


>Q2: Which data collection methods would you consider using?


Note that you may find that you could be using a mixture of both the research methods and the data collection methods. These considerations should be included in your presentation of the Project Proposal in Unit 10.
