# Unit 3 ePortfolio Activity: Research Proposal Review

>Note that you may find that you could be using a mixture of both the research methods and the data collection methods. These considerations should be included in your presentation of the Project Proposal in Unit 10.

>Considering your thoughts on your chosen area of interest for your project:

>Q1: Which of the methods described in this week's reading would you think would suit your purpose?

I believe a mixed methods approach would be best suited for my proposal, as the topic is heavily dependent on both qualitative and quantitative data. I would like to be able to quantify the impact of communication technology on employee productivity, but I would also like to be able to understand the qualitative aspects of the impact. I believe that a mixed methods approach would be best suited to this.

>Q2: Which data collection methods would you consider using?

Using surveys and interviews would be an efficient way to collect data for the qualitative aspects of the research, and using surveys and case studies for quantitative research would most likely produce optimal results.
