# Unit 6: Wiki Activity: Questionnaires

> Find a questionnaire and critique the design, both the format and the questions used.
> Consider areas such as ‘why is this question included?’, ‘is the form of the question appropriate?’ etc. How can you improve the questionnaire?
> Put your analysis in the module wiki and comment on others’ analyses.


Unfortunately, I did not complete this activity. Instead, I devoted time to unit activities and assignments.
