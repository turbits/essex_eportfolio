# Unit 6: Questionnaire Design - Unit Description

Welcome to week 6 where we will be looking at the various aspects of designing a questionnaire.

To start, let us clarify the difference between a questionnaire and a survey. A survey is a comprehensive method used for the gathering and analysis of data and will involve a questionnaire. A questionnaire on the other hand, just refers to the set of questions with answer choices which is used to conduct a survey. 

So, a questionnaire is a valuable research instrument as it offers a researcher flexibility in gaining information from respondents, like a written interview. It can be carried out online, over the phone or face-to-face.

The type of questions you use (open or closed, or both) will depend on whether you are carrying out quantitative or qualitative research, or mixed method). Some questionnaires are better than others and mistakes are easy to make, especially when you are working in a technical area.

**In this unit we shall:**
- Introduce the different methods of obtaining responses.
- Discuss how to improve the responses you obtain.
- Consider how you would analyse the responses from each type of question.

**On completion of this unit you will be able to:**
- Tell the difference between a good questionnaire and a poor one.
- Design a questionnaire to obtain the responses you will need for your investigation.
- Understand how the data obtained can be analysed.
