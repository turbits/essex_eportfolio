Welcome to Week 2 where you will be introduced to the various aspects of a research proposal, starting with defining a research question.

>The good researcher is not ‘one who knows the right answers’, but is ‘one who is struggling to find out what the right questions might be'
>
>- by Phillips & Pugh, 2010

Defining the topic of your research may be a tedious process but it is essential to ensure you are successful in your research. You will start with an initial research idea and then ask pertinent questions that may need further revisions before you prepare your research proposal, which is the foundation to your research.

One element of the proposal is a literature review within your chosen area. A literature review is a survey of scholarly sources on a specific topic. It provides an overview of current knowledge, allowing you to identify relevant theories, methods, and gaps in the existing research. In this unit, you will be introduced to the process of completing a literature review and how to present your review. This will be based on a list of topics, from which you will choose one that interests you the most.

**In this unit we shall:**
- Look at how you formulate and revise research questions.
- Look at all the parts that make up a research proposal and how to present your thoughts.
- Explain what a literature review is, how to perform it and how to present it.

**On completion of this unit you will be able to:**
- Examine the characteristics that make up a suitable research topic.
- Explore rational and creative methods for formulating a research idea.
- Identify means of transforming research ideas into crafted research questions and proposal.
- Conduct a literature search, critique the literature and to present a literature review.

## Formative Activities

Continue with the Unit 1 Discussion forum. Considering what you have now learned in both units, you should respond to at least two of your peers’ contributions from Unit 1. Please try to limit your posts to 200-300 words maximum, so that others may be encouraged to reflect on, and respond to your ideas. Your follow-up responses should be labelled as 'Peer Response'. For guidance, look at the guidelines for the peer review process on the Department’s homepage. This provides an excellent way to understand and constructively feedback on other peoples’ points of view. Some reading to help you with your responses can be found in the Bott (2018) Unit 2 Reading depending on the scenario you have chosen.

- Plan your Literature Review and Research Proposal Outlines. (See below)
- Prepare for next week's seminar session by attempting the Unit 3 preparation questions.
