__*Text Version*__

Thank you for your insightful post Hamad. You bring up a good point where you say "...make their operations legally permissible but ethically questionable." - I considered the lack of legislation as more of a legally grey area rather than strictly permissible, but you are technically correct. Their actions were certainly ethically questionable, and arguable totally unethical. Rogue put private interest above public interest, and conducted themselves in a manner that indicated that they either did not consider the impact of their actions on the public, or that they determined their actions were acceptable.

Your following statement, referenced from Tavani, H.T., "legality does not always equate to ethicality" (Tavani, 2012) is also an intriguing point. I believe I agree with this statement, but in my opinion, I would also argue that the reverse is true. Laws differ by country and ethics can be quite subjective, depending on the situation. Considering ones actions and the balance of them against the perceived positives can be a difficult task, and I believe that laws are in place to, generally, assist one in this balancing act. Your conclusion that the actions of the computing professionals involved made an unethical decision differs from mine, for example. I have also noticed that you appear to contradict yourself here, when stating that computing professionals "have a duty to maintain integrity and competence" but then stating that their actions were "considered unlawful"; I would argue that your initial point of "legality does not always equate to ethicality" applies here. To me, they were acting in the public interest, they showed professional competence and integrity (well crafted, purpose-built malware to minimize collateral damage), they partnered with relevant authorities to ensure their actions were considered lawful, and through these previous actions proved their duty to their profession by considering the ethical and legal aspects of their actions (BCS, n.d.).
