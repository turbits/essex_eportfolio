## Overview

This unit is an introduction to the module. We had to choose a topic for the literature review assignment. I chose the topic "The Impact of Communication Technology on Employee Productivity During Government Mandated Lockdown" which had an optional sub-topic of "in a country of your choice", I chose Canada.

My literature review choice: ***The Impact of Communication Technology on Employee Productivity During Government Mandated Lockdown in Canada***
