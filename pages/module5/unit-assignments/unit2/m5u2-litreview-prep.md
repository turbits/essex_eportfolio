## Literature Review Guide Questions

*The Impact of Communication Technology on Employee Productivity During Government Mandated Lockdown in Canada*

### 1. What is the focus and aim of your review? Who is your audience?

The focus of my review is to examine the relationship between communication technology and productivity in the workplace in the context of government-mandated lockdowns in Canada. I aim to explore how various communications technologies, such as video and tele-conferencing, instant messaging platforms, project management software, VoIP and PBX phone systems, email, and other technologies have impacted employee productivity level during the COVID-19 pandemic. The intended audience for this literature review includes academics, researchers, policy makers, and professionals interesting in the intersection of communication technology and productivity in the Canadian labour force.

### 2. Why is there a need for your review? Why is it significant?

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the Canadian labour force. As a result of the pandemic, many organizations have been forced to adapt to a remote work environment. This has resulted in a significant increase in the use of communication technologies to facilitate remote work. The impact of this shift in the workplace has been unprecendented, and it is important to understand how this shift has impacted employee productivity. This literature review will provide insight into the topic, and will help to inform future research on the topic.

### 3. What is the context of the topic or issue? What perspective do you take? What framework do you use to synthesise the literature?

The COVID-19 pandemic pressured countries, governments, businesses, and individuals into adopting compltely new lifestyles and ways of working. The context of this particular review pertains to the affect it had on the Canadian workforce.

### 4. How did you locate and select sources for the inclusion in the review?

To locate and select sources for inclusion in my review I used Google Search Engine and Google Scholar, JSTOR.org, and various Government of Canada websites. Reoccurring terms that I used were "pandemic", "COVID-19", "employee productivity", "communication technology", "remote work", "work from home". For specific touch-points such as referencing statistics, I always attempted to find the source from the organization first, then using a trusted news source if the information was not available from the organization.

### 6. What are the main findings in the literature on this topic?

My prelimenary main findings are:
- Communication technology has had a positive impact on employee productivity during the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Flexible work arrangements have been shown to increase employee productivity.
- Technilogical challenges and distractions have been shown to decrease employee productivity.
- The increase in reliance on digital forms of communication has also negatively impacted employees health. Some of these include:
    - Increase in stress levels, burnout, and anxiety via information overload, digital fatigue, and decrease in physical activity and physical social interaction.
    - Decrease in work-life balance.
    - Increase in work hours, in some cases, contributing to the above.
- Increase in cyber security threats.
- Increase in employee monitoring.

### 7. What are the main strengths and limitations of this literature?

Stengths:
- The literature is recent and relevant to this day.
- It contains a vast variety of sources, including academic journals, news articles, and government websites.
- It is often multidisciplinary, involving research from other topics such as psychology, organizational behaviour, human-computer interaction, information technology, and more.
- The literature has practical perspective, and includes case studies and surveys, statistics, and other data.

Limitations:
- The literature is often unspecific, preferring a general approach to the topic from a global perspective, rather than a specific approach from a Canadian perspective.
- It is difficult to find long-term studies on the topic, as the pandemic is ongoing.
- The literature can be biased, being written by organizations or individuals that have a vested interested in the topic, such as technology companies or agencies at various levels of government.

### 8. Are there any discrepancies in this literature?

- The literature may have mixed findings, potentially contradictory
- Sources may have different perspectives on the same topic
- There may be differences in the methodology used in the research
- The literature could contain differences in the context of the topic, such as the sector or industry, country, or other factors
- Due to the ongoing nature of the pandemic, there may be insights or findings that are not yet available or have been invalidated by new information, such as short-term versus long-term studies of the topic

### 9. What conclusions do you draw from this literature? What do you argue needs to be done as an outcome of the review?

Conclusions:
- Communication technology has had an unprecedented impact on employees and organizations during the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Technological proficiency, organizational support, work-life balance, and other factors have a significant impact on the relationship between communication technology and employee productivity.
- The impact of communication technology on productivity is context-specific, with variations based on industry, organizational culture, and job role.

Outcomes:
- Organizations should invest in providing adequate mental health support for employees.
- Leaders should be trained to effectively, empathetically, and inclusively manage remote teams.
- Further research in the field as the pandemic progresses is required to support long-term studies of the affects of communication technology on employee productivity.

Overall, the review suggests the importance of understanding and effectively managing the relationship between communication technology and employee productivity in the workplace during government-mandated lockdowns. It emphasizes the need for a balanced approach that considers both the benefits and the drawbacks of a remote work environment, and the importance of providing adequate support for employees to optimize productivity and promote well-being in an actively evolving work landscape.
