# Unit 11: Professional Development - Your ePortfolio - Unit Description

Welcome to week 11 where we will be considering your professional development based on your e- Portfolio. In this module, your e-Portfolio is due for submission in Unit 12.

Various studies have shown that having an e-Portfolio is useful to students, and professionals, regardless of the industry in which you work. You would have discussed the use of e-Portfolios during your induction and some of the points made may have surprised you or just confirmed your experience. Having reached this module, your e-Portfolio would have been reviewed as a summative and formative assessment piece throughout your programme of study. The goal was to ensure that you have a comprehensive set of materials that covered your entire learning journey on this programme. This enables you to create a Showcase e-Portfolio at the end of your programme, which can be shared with peers or employers.

Carrying out reflections on your learning during the various modules would have provided you with some insight on how you learn and how that impacts your professional practice. This should be the basis for the completion of your professional skills matrix, , leading to the development of an action plan that should prove useful to you beyond your degree programme (Continuous Professional Development). The final aspect to the e-Portfolio is the Learning Loop. This tool provides a holistic review of your degree programme, your development so far and your plans for the future. It can also act as a feedback tool for the academic team, if you wish to share it.

**In this unit we shall:**
- Review your learning approach based on your reflections on your learning process.
- Review the Professional Skills matrix, considering your professional goals and the outcomes of the modules you have undertaken in your programme.

**On completion of this unit you will be able to:**
- Provide necessary reflection for the completion your learning loop.
- Complete the Professional Skills matrix and ensuing action plan.

This week is a culmination of the various professional practice discussions that have taken place in this module. The e-Portfolio is a key tool for recording professional practice and reflecting on processes and outcomes.
