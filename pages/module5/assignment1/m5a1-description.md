Assignment Brief

The literature review fulfils the learning outcomes where you will critically evaluate existing literature, research design and methodology for your chosen topic and so produce a literature review on this topic. 

You will have selected the topic for this task from the list provided in Unit 1. You should refer to the Guide Questions provided in Unit 2 to evaluate and refine your literature review before submission, bearing in mind the key aims of a standalone literature review (with the applicable grading criterion highlighted from the grid on the Module Resources page):

    To demonstrate an awareness of relevant, current literature. (Use of Relevant sources weighted at 20%)
    To highlight similar and contrasting views on your chosen topic. (Criticality weighted at 30%)
    To showcase your research and writing skills. (Structure and Presentation weighted at 10%, Academic Integrity weighted at 10%)

    Evaluate critically existing literature, research design and methodology for the chosen topic, including data analysis processes.

Turnitin Originality Check

Before submitting your assignment, it is important to check the originality of your work by submitting your assignment to Turnitin.

By submitting your assignment to this tool you will receive an originality report which can be used to check that you have not included other authors work without correct citation. It is important to note that submitting your work to the Turnitin Originality Check tool does not count as a submission of your final work. You must still submit your assignment below.
Academic Integrity and Plagiarism

We take academic integrity very seriously. Academic integrity means acting with fairness and honesty, giving credit to others where you are referring to their ideas or research and respecting the work of others. Plagiarism is defined as: 'Using or copying the work of others (whether written, printed or in any other form) without proper acknowledgement'. Before you finalise your assignment take time to check that all your statements are backed up with supporting evidence, that all sources you use - whether referring to their ideas, quoting directly or paraphrasing - are correctly referenced in the text. Correct use of referencing acknowledges the academic whose work has informed yours, enables the reader to find the sources you have used and demonstrates your ability to find and analyse relevant information. 

Failure to properly acknowledge the work of others is an academic offence and may result in your work incurring a penalty or, in the most serious cases, you being removed from the course for academic dishonesty.

If you are unsure about referencing or plagiarism there are useful resources available in the Study Skills Hub which is accessible from the menu on the left hand side. If you are still experiencing difficulties with academic integrity then you can contact the Study Skills Team for individualised support studyskills-kol@kaplan.com 

Please note, a word count penalty applies to this assessment.

If your assessment exceeds the word count limit or range by more than 10% then your awarded grade will be reduced by 10% grade points. For more information please see your student handbook.

Not meeting the word count

There is no grade reduction applied if your assignment does not meet the word count range or limit, but to maximise your opportunity to achieve the highest grade possible, you should aim to meet the word count or range as closely as possible.
