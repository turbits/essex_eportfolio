# Module 5: Assignment 2: Research Proposal Presentation - Assignment Description

This is the second summative assessment for this module and accounts for 30% of your final module mark. Submit by end of Unit 10.

**Assignment Brief**

The research proposal presentation fulfils the learning outcomes where you will evaluate critically existing literature, research design and methodology for your chosen topic, including data analysis processes and so produce and evaluate critically a research proposal for your chosen topic. This can be based on the literature review topic you chose in Unit 1 or the topic of your capstone project for MSc Students (MSc students - Please see the BCS Project Requirements document on the Module Resources page and also the CyBOK Knowledge Base for those taking on Cyber Security Projects as your Cyber Security project should fall into one of these CyBOK Knowledge Areas, as well as meeting BCS requirements).

You are required to create an audio-narrated slide presentation and a transcript in which you will present the following sections. These sections are required in a standard research proposal for the Computing department. You are free to combine/merge sections, where appropriate and without detriment to the structure of your presentation. 
- Project Title.
- Significance/Contribution to the discipline/Research Problem.
- Research Question.
- Aims and Objectives.
- Key literature related to the project.
- Methodology/Development strategy/Research Design.
- Ethical considerations and risk assessment (as part of your ethical approval application).
- Description of artefact(s) that will be created (if applicable).
- Timeline of proposed activities.

**Instructions**

For this assignment, you are required to record a 15-minute presentation, along with a transcript of the audio file. The presentation slides should not be wordy or repeat verbatim the oral presentation. Visuals, illustration, statistics, charts, tables and indication of key pointers are welcome. In assessing the presentation for marking, emphasis will be placed on the oral content. However, clarity of the visual presentation will also be taken into account.

It is strongly recommended that, in order to record your presentation, you use a headset with a microphone.

There is no word count for the slide presentation, and there is no fixed word count for the oral presentation/transcript. However, note that an average speech rate for a comfortable and clearly orally paced presentation is about 100-150 words per minute. Given that your presentation should be about 15 minutes, you can work against a minimum of 1500 to a maximum of 2250 words in your oral presentation/transcript.

Before submitting the work, consider the following checklist in conjunction with the applicable grading criteria (see the Module Resources page): 

**Knowledge and Understanding weighted 25%, Use of relevant sources weighted at 5%:**
- Are the major points identified? 
- Are the details presented clearly? 

**Criticality weighted at 25%, Use of relevant sources weighted at 5%:**
- Is there a critical discussion/analysis of your methodology/design?

**Structure and Presentation weighted at 10%:**
- Is the presentation well organised? 

**Presentation and Communication Skills weighted at 30%:**
- Is the presentation clearly introduced and concluded?
- Is the presentation well-paced and timed?
- Is the information presented clearly and concisely?
- Is the presentation style lively, fluent and engaging? 

**Slide Presentation & Audio Guidance**

**Slide Presentation Guidance**

If you do not have access to PowerPoint, you may use Google Slides, which is a free cloud-based and multiplatform slide presentation application that you can use on most modern web browsers. If you are an Apple Mac user, you may also use Keynote which is pre-installed on all Apple Mac Laptops and PC's. If you do make use of either of these applications, please make sure to save your presentation in PowerPoint format.

How to save your presentation in the PowerPoint format:
- [Apple Keynote](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202220)
- [Google Slides](https://www.solveyourtech.com/download-google-slides-presentation-powerpoint-file/)

**Audio Guidance**

If you have access to PowerPoint, you can record your narration directly onto your presentation slide. If you do not have access to PowerPoint and you are using an alternative slide presentation application, we recommend that you record your narration separately and upload this file as an additional attachment. You can use an online application called Online Voice Recorder to record your audio. Read guidance on how to use the Online Voice Recorder before starting.

**Please ensure that your citations and list of references are included in the slides and citations mentioned in your transcript.**

**Please note!** Do not submit your files as a zipped folder. Upload all your files separately. If your file size is too big, consider optimising images, audio and transitions used to reduce the file size. The file size limit is 500MB.

**Learning Outcomes**
- Evaluate critically existing literature, research design and methodology for the chosen topic, including data analysis processes.
- Produce and evaluate critically a research proposal for the chosen topic.
