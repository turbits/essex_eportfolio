Unfortunately, the slide presentation was not recorded with audio - I've had no need to use PowerPoint before, so used what was comfortable for me. I used Audacity to record the voiceover and thought I would be able to insert the audio and time it after the fact, apparently that is not the case.

Instead, I've included the presentation, a separate audio file, and the transcript.
For convenience, I've also recut the presentation and audio into a video and uploaded to YouTube here: https://youtu.be/GB-l6u8D6dk

Thanks!
