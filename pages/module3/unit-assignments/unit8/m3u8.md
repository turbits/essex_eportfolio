## Unit Requirements

Welcome to Week 8 where we will investigate the principles, technology and use of cryptography and how it is used with operating systems.

### In this unit we shall:
- Look at what is meant by cryptography and examine a case study in how it can be applied to operating systems.
- Explore some common cryptographic libraries.
- Create a basic application that uses cryptographic libraries to encode sample data.


### On completion of this unit you will be able to:
- Describe some of the issues encountered with cryptographic libraries.
- Explain the pros and cons of using common cryptographic libraries.
- Demonstrate the use of cryptographic libraries in a simple application.


This week we will look at the importance of cryptography in modern systems; how it is used, the libraries available and how to include libraries in a simple application.
