### 📝 Requirements

Welcome to Week 7 where we will discuss Operating Systems (OS) and their relationships to programming languages and security. Most applications need to interact with the underlying operating system – whether it is to pick up input from a keyboard (or other input device) or to output data to a display. There are also security implications because such interactions often require the user application to link with software libraries – either supplied by the OS provider or a third party.

#### In this unit we shall:
- Define the type and functions of a typical Operating System.
- Give examples of common operating systems.
- Explain the differences between processes, threads and schedulers.
- Describe key approaches to make OSes more secure.
- Discuss the difference between virtualisation approaches.
- Advise on the differences between dynamic and shared libraries.

#### On completion of this unit you will be able to:
- Describe mitigations to make operating systems more secure.
- Explain some of the key risks and vulnerabilities associated with operating systems.
- Outline the differences between static and dynamic libraries and when to use each.


This week will help you to understand the implications, risks and challenges in selecting an operating system and how virtualisation affects security.
