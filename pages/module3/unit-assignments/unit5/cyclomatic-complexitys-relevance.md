## Module 3: Unit 5: Exploring Cyclomatic Complexity's Relevance Today

### Assignment Instructions

The Cyclomatic Complexity is commonly considered in modules on testing the validity of code design today. However, in your opinion, should it be? Does it remain relevant today? Specific to the focus of this module, is it relevant in our quest to develop secure software? Justify all opinions which support your argument and share your responses with your team.

#### Teamwork
You can share your team responses with the tutor for formative feedback or discuss it in next week‚Äôs seminar.

#### Learning Outcomes
Identify and manage security risks as part of a software development project.

Critically analyse development problems and determine appropriate methodologies, tools and techniques (including program design and development) to solve them.

Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real-life perspectives on team roles and organisation.


### ü§î My Reflections

1. The Cyclomatic Complexity is commonly considered in modules on testing the validity of code design today. However, in your opinion, should it be?
    - A: To directly answer this, yes, it should be considered. To expand on that answer, there are people that their entire job is to dictate whether this is a valid metric or not, and my opinion is mostly irrelevant here. If I were to disagree, it would be illogical. So yes, in my opinion it should be considered.

2. Does it remain relevant today?
    - A: At it's root, this is the same question as the previous, worded differently. As I outlined in my previous answer, yes, it is relevant.

3. Specific to the focus of this module, is it relevant in our quest to develop secure software?
    - A: Again, yes it is relevant. It is a metric that can be used to determine the complexity of a program, and thus the complexity of the security issues that may arise from it. It's certainly not the "end all be all", but it is a relevant and important metric to consider when developing secure software.
