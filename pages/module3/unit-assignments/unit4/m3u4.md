## Unit 4: Exploring Programming Language Concepts

The formative activities for Unit 4 were to complete the portfolio activity "Programming language concepts" and record results/ideas/feedback, and to participate in this week's seminar and seminar preperation; see links below.

The seminars are outside of my available time (they are UTC, I'm on UTC-7, and they occur during my work hours), so I unfortunately can't participate in them. However, I do go back over the recordings and review when I can.
