## Unit 3: Programming Languages: History, Concepts, and Design

The formative activities for Unit 3 were to continue Unit 1's requirements, and to write a summary post based on our initial post and feedback from our peers. I did not find the time to write a summary post. I did, however, have a dialogue with the course's tutor on my own post regarding sequence diagrams and the use of Actors in them. I also learned that databases should not be directly included in sequence diagrams, but instead be visualized with a boundary object. I have included those posts here to show an understanding of the topic and learning progress in the course.
