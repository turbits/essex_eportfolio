## Unit 12: Seminar Preparation

I did not complete this component as a team, and instead opted to complete it individually. I have included my answer below.

### üìù Requirements

Read Biggs et al (2018) and Bucchiarone et al (2018) as examples of modern views and approaches to the Monolithic vs. Microservices/ Microkernel debate.
- Post your team‚Äôs stance to the forum along with justifications.
- Read all the arguments for each position.
- Choose one team response that disagrees with your team stance and post a message that refutes their argument.
- During this week‚Äôs seminar session, all students will independently vote for which argument they believe was presented most persuasively.

### ü§î Response

The prompt "post your team's stance" isn't really thorough; our stance on what exactly? I have chosen to answer the question similar to the [last unit](/pages/module3/unit-assignments/unit11/debate.html) where I was asked to post my stance on the Tanenbaum-Torvalds debate, from the succint prompt "Are microservices and microkernels the future?".

I stated in my previous response that microservices and microkernels were not necessarily "the future", but they had transformed the way software is developed. These are options for software, but not a panacea. They alone will not solve all issues, but they could be a good option for some products.

The two articles that this unit asks us to read are "The Jury Is In: Monolithic OS Design Is Flawed" by Biggs et al (2018), and "From Monolithic To Microservices: An Experience Report from the Banking Domain" by Bucchiarone et al (2018). These articles outline microkernels and microservices in different domains for different purposes. Both articles are interesting and very detailed in their accounts.

These articles detail the benefits of microkernels and microservices in their respective domains, and how these domains have become more efficient because of them. These are domains that are extremely large by comparison to most domains, operating systems and banking systems are some of the most complex domains in the world. It stands to reason that these architectures would be an ideal option for these domains because of the nature of the architecture, the domains, the complexity, the requirement for scalability, and the need for high availability.
