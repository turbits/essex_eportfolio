The formative activities for Unit 2 were to continue Unit 1's requirements.

## Requirements

### Formative Activities

- Continue the discussion in unit 1. You should choose at least two of your peers' contributions and comment on the weakness they chose, as well as:

  - What do you like about their flowchart?
  - In what way(s) might it be improved?

- Your posts should be a maximum of 300 words. Please include sufficient content so that others may be encouraged to reflect on and respond to your ideas. Your follow-up responses should be labelled as ‚ÄúPeer Response‚Äù. You should do this before working through the preparation for Seminar 1.

- e-Portfolio ‚Äì If you haven‚Äôt already done so, take the time to review the requirements of the e- portfolio. If you have created one, feel free to share and provide constructive feedback to your peers. You will need to create a summary of your discussion posts and peer responses for your e-portfolio.
