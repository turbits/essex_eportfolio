## Module 3: Assignment 1: Design Proposal Document

In this module we were assigned to teams; my team was Team Transparency. Our first assignment was to create a technical specification/design document for a "secure repository". See below for specifics.

### üìù Requirements

For this assessment, you are advised to position yourself and your team as IT Software Consultants and Developers.

You are required to develop an application that provides a secure repository for an organisation with domain-specific requirements. A domain refers to a group of users with similar application and hardware requirements. A domain may be characterised by having:

- periodic pressure on resources (CPU, storage, or the network)
- interactive response requirements between request and reply
- substantial data download requirements
- Such requirements place specific demands on a system‚Äôs operations, and this - influences the way that it should be operated and managed.

Domains which you should consider for the purpose of this assignment include (see the Unit reading list for the appropriate links):

- the International Space Station (NASA, 2007)
- the Dutch Police Internet Forensics (Government of the Netherlands, n.d.)
- the Hadron Collider at CERN (The Computer Security Team, 2020)

You can read more about the computer requirements of these systems using the references given. You should choose a single domain to focus your development on, and your system should be tailored to the requirements of this domain. In all domains, a user will need to be able to upload and download data.

#### Application requirements:

The agreed criteria for successful development are:

- The application should support access via a web browser and/or a command line application that will allow an authenticated user to perform the suite of CRUD capabilities.
- The solution should ensure that all privacy and security regulations are met, including those specified by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (ICO, n.d.)
- Mechanisms should be deployed to minimise the attack surface of the solution. At a minimum, the application should include authentication, authorisation, data encryption, and event monitoring.
- The organisation would like to see a distributed/microservice version of the application because they have concerns about scalability, and they may wish to extend use to partner organisations on a worldwide basis
- At least two events occurring within and/or around the application should run while the application is live, using a concurrent threading approach. These should be specific and relevant to your chosen domain.

Your full brief is to:

- Create a comprehensive design proposal report, describing how you will meet the requirements, and the design and implementation of the solution.
- You should create a working prototype of your microservice design via a command line (CL) application.

#### Part 1: The Design Proposal Document

Your team is expected to prepare and deliver a design proposal report of your intended development work for the organisation. Note that the associated grading criteria are highlighted in the requirements below, to be reviewed alongside the criteria grid (Module Resources).

Your report should detail the system requirements and assumptions (such as local or remote access, magnitude of storage required, CPU capacity, the roles of users who are accessing the system, concurrent data streams which will run while the application is live), design decisions (such as encryption algorithm(s), approach to data storage, use of a database, design pattern(s) used) and approaches that you have adopted to create your secure system solution (such as authorisation or authentication). Build up a rationale where appropriate supported by literature (Knowledge and Understanding weighted at 25%)

It should list security challenges you have identified/ expect to encounter (such as those in the STRIDE model and/or those forming the OWASP principles). Highlight (briefly) what paradigm(s), pattern(s), theories and practices you intend to utilise on this project to address security, technical, and business challenges. Justify your approaches supported by literature. (Application and Understanding weighted at 25%)

You should produce a minimum of two different graphical UML design which illustrate different views of the system. The modules used might include a sequence diagram, class diagram, and/or an activity diagram. AND

You should also state any tools and libraries that you will use in your solution. (Criticality weighted at 25%)
Presentation and Structure of your work (weighted at 25%) includes spelling, style, evidence of proofreading, correct use (and format) of citations and references.

Please note that appendices should not be used to extend the core report as reports should stand alone, complete and concise, without the appendices. They should really only be used if required, and only for supplementary and/ or supporting information. One key part of the exercises in this module is the need to be to be able to express ideas succinctly, concisely and with necessary brevity.

#### Checklist for the assignment:

- Bulleted list of system requirements and assumptions, design decisions and approaches you will use based on background information and additional academic research (ensure you include any references you have used);
- Bulleted list of security risks/ vulnerabilities you have identified, including reference to frameworks used (e.g. STRIDE, OWASP) with potential mitigations and references;
- UML design of solution using multiple diagrams (e.g. class, sequence, activity) with references;
- Bulleted list of tools (including development and test tools), libraries and models you will use;

Remember to use a spell checker and proofread your work before submission.

You should get your design outline reviewed and approved by your tutor BEFORE you submit the final version in this Unit. You are invited to arrange a meeting between your team and the tutor to get feedback.
