# Unit 2: Vulnerability Analysis - Literature Review Activity

👉[My Reflection](#my-reflection)


## Instructions

Using the website(s) assigned to you in Unit 1, carry out the following exercise and answer the questions listed below.

Carry out a literature search/audit on software sites and the national vulnerabilities database to create a baseline audit on potential vulnerabilities with websites.

## Learning Outcomes

- Identify and analyse security threats and vulnerabilities in network systems and determine appropriate methodologies, tools and techniques to manage and/or solve them.
- Design and critically appraise computer programs and systems to produce solutions that help manage and audit risk and security issues.
- Gather and synthesise information from multiple sources (including internet security alerts and warning sites) to aid in the systematic analysis of security breaches and issues.

## Reflection

Reflect on this activity by answering the following questions:
- Did you have any issues or challenges with the literature search/audit on software sites and the national vulnerabilities database?
- How did you overcome them?
- How will they affect your final report?

Record all reflections in your e-portfolio. Find guidance on creating a GitHub accout and e-Portfolio in the Module Resources tab.

## My Reflection

The website I was assigned (that I chose) was https://copperplate.org.uk. The task was to create a baseline audit on potential vulnerabilities with, I'm assuming websites in general, based on the unfortunately ambiguous wording. That being said, these are the steps that I would take to create a baseline audit on a target with potential vulnerabilities:

1. Literature Search
    - Conduct literature search on most common web vulnerabilities.
    - Research academic journals, research papers, and other credible sources such as the Insitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).
    - Focus reasearch on web application security, common vulnerabilities, secure coding practices, web security best practices, and web security standards.
2. National Vulnerabilities Database (NVD)
    - Conduct a search on the National Vulnerabilities Database (NVD)
    - Search for vulnerabilities related to the target's tech stack; in my case this was Coppermine Gallery, Softaculous, jQuery, etc.
    - In the case of https://copperplate.org.uk, there were vulnerabilities, many high and one critical, but none of them applied to the assumed version that the target was running.
3. Software Sites
    - Conduct research on software that the website was running
    - Attempt to locate and review any public code repositories to find possible attack vectors or vulnerabilities
    - Review security advisories, bug reports, changelogs, and other documentation to find possible attack vectors or vulnerabilities
4. Web Security Best Practices
    - Study web security best practices from credible sources such as the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
    - Attempt to identify any non-compliance, such as insecure coding if code is available, validation issues, proper authentication and session management, etc.

The information that I gathered to form a potential audit baseline was educational, and I learned quite a bit concerning security standards (NIST CSF) and regulation (GDPR). I cannot say the same for the proposed "target" websites that we were provided as part of the course and the assignments for writing a vulnerability assessment and executive summary for them. I touched on this in my final assignment, my [Reflective Piece](/pages/module4/assignment3/m4a3.html), but in my opinion the course would have been better served by a simple capture-the-flag type of scenario that is readily available from websites such as [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/hacker/ctf), [PentesterLab](https://pentesterlab.com/), and [Defend the Web](https://defendtheweb.net/). I feel that this would have been a better use of time and resources, and would have provided a more realistic and practical experience for students, rather than "here is a generic website you don't have access to and are not allowed to run exploitative testing on".

To directly answer the questions posed in the assignment:

>Q: Did you have any issues or challenges with the literature search/audit on software sites and the national vulnerabilities database?

A: No, I did not have any issues with this specifically; the database and related software sites for my particular target were easy to find and research.

>Q: How did you overcome them?

A: See first answer. I did not have any issues finding or utilising any applicable resources, including the NVD and software sites (such as the public [repo](https://github.com/coppermine-gallery/cpg1.6.x) for Coppermine Gallery 1.6.x)

>Q: How will they affect your final report?

A: See previous answer.
