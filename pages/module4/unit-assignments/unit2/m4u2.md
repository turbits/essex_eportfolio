### ePortfolio Component

- Collaborative Discussion 1: Digitalisation - What are the security implications of the digital economy
    - The second week of your discussion forum.
- Vulnerability Analysis - Literature Review Activity

### Unit Description

Welcome to Week 2. This week we will revisit the Cyber Kill Chain model proposed by Lockheed Martin (Hutchins et al, 2011) and apply it to a modern case study - the solar winds exploit (Temple-Raston, 2021) to explore if the well-known Cyber Kill Chain model is still as applicable for the analysis of modern Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs).

In this unit we shall:
- Discuss the impact of APTs and review the Cyber Kill Chain model.
- Review the solar winds exploit (Temple-Raston, 2021).
- Evaluate if the model helps explain and mitigate the exploit.

On completion of this unit you will be able to:
- Describe the Cyber Kill Chain model.
- Apply the model to analyse a well-known APT.
- Describe possible mitigations to avoid a similar exploit.

### Module Wiki Definition Addition

*I added the APT definition to the module wiki; definition as follows:*

> *An Advanced Persistent Threat, or APT, is a cyber attack that is sophisticated and sustained in nature. An attacker establishes a foothold in a network using means to stay undetected. Attackers will use multiple techniques to initially gain access to a network, including social engineering, misconfiguration, and vulnerabilities in software and hardware. The attacker then escalates and moves laterally, gaining access to systems based on the attacker's goals. Often, an attacker will move to gain access to high-value target systems such as file servers, databases, and executive and administrative user systems and accounts. The attacker will then begin storing and exfiltrating information from the network while maintaining persistence in the network. Attackers will often use distraction techniques to divert the attention of administrators away from the exfiltration.*
