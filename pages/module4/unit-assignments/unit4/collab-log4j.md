## Activity Description

## Discussion Topic

Read Berger (2021) and Ekelhart et al (2019) and then post your thoughts on the issues of logging for security analysis versus the issues of log-related exploits. You should support your arguments with appropriate academic references.

**Learning Outcomes**
- Identify and analyse security threats and vulnerabilities in network systems and determine appropriate methodologies, tools and techniques to manage and/or solve them.
- Design and critically appraise computer programs and systems to produce solutions that help manage and audit risk and security issues.
- Gather and synthesise information from multiple sources (including internet security alerts and warning sites) to aid in the systematic analysis of security breaches and issues.

**Discussion Guidance**
- Your initial posting should respond to the question and be at least 200 words long. This should be labelled as 'Initial Post'
- You will then respond to at least 2 of your peers' posts in unit 5 (each labelled as 'Peer Response'). To guide your responses, look at the guidelines for the peer review process on the Department‚Äôs homepage. Focus on the possible measures that could have been put in place in order to prevent the incidents highlighted by your peers. Please try to limit your response posts to 200-300 words maximum, so that others may be encouraged to reflect on, and respond to your ideas. 
- Referencing: When you have referred to other authors thoughts, ideas and opinions in your posts, you must reference the author as you would in an academic assignment using the UoEO Harvard reference style.
- You will not be assessed on your contribution to this forum throughout the module, but the tutor will post group feedback via a module announcement.
- This activity forms a component of your e-portfolio which you should continue to build throughout your programme. All e-portfolio activities are intended to demonstrate your ability and strengths through evidence and reflection.
