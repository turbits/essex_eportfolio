# Unit 4: Case Study: Reviewing an Assessment Reporting Template

## Table of Contents

- 👉[PurpleSec Sample Vulnerability Assessment Report](https://purplesec.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Sample-Vulnerability-Assessment-Report-PurpleSec.pdf)

## Activity Description

You are tasked with reviewing the assessment template from PurpleSec.

## Instructions

Answer the following questions:
- Does this template meet the NCSC stated requirement of preparing a baseline to use as a reference point for pen tests? If not what changes/amendments would you make?
- What are the two best lessons/examples presented in the report?
- What two things do you think are unnecessary or could be done more effectively?

## Learning Outcomes
- Identify and analyse security threats and vulnerabilities in network systems and determine appropriate methodologies, tools and techniques to manage and/or solve them.
- Design and critically appraise computer programs and systems to produce solutions that help manage and audit risk and security issues.
- Gather and synthesise information from multiple sources (including internet security alerts and warning sites) to aid in the systematic analysis of security breaches and issues.

## Reflection

Reflect on this activity by answering the following questions:
- Did you have any issues or challenges with this activity?
- How did you overcome them?
- How will they affect your final report?
- Record all reflections in your e-portfolio. There will also be an opportunity to discuss your comments at next week's seminar.


## My Reflection

Issues I had during this activity were due to coursework not properly referencing what document or material was being referred to by "NCSC stated requirement of preparing a baseline to use as a reference point for pen tests". Instead I have separately reviewed the Public Sector Cyber Security Baseline Standards (NCSC, 2021). This standard is based off the NIST CSF framework (NIST, n.d.).

>Q: Does this template meet the NCSC stated requirement of preparing a baseline to use as a reference point for pen tests? If not what changes/amendments would you make?

A: Unfortunately, due to unit 4's coursework not properly referencing material, I can't answer this directly. I was unable to find whatever material was in reference to this question, but one can assume, based on PurpleSec's experience and reputation, that the template does indeed meet any requirements put forth by NCSC for a baseline to use as a reference point for penetration tests, with one particular section perhaps being the exception. See the last question regarding changes/amendments.

>Q: What are the two best lessons/examples presented in the report?

A: In my opinion, the two best examples are the risk assessment, showing identified vulnerabilities and their associated descriptions and risk ratings, and the executive summary, showing a high-level overview of the engagement. 

>Q: What two things do you think are unnecessary or could be done more effectively?

A: The supposed password policy in this document is lacking for most applications. Placing a maximum age on a password has been proven to be not only ineffective, but in fact detrimental to security (SANS, 2019). Microsoft has even changed their guidance on password expiration policy, calling it "ancient and obsolete" (Microsoft, 2019). The policy is also lacking in that it does not reference multi-factor or passwordless authentication whatsoever, the latter being "even safer than a traditional username + password login" (Gontovnikas, 2017).
