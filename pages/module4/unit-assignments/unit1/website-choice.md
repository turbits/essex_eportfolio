## Website Choice Instructions

You should have already selected a website in the Website Choice Activity. The first activity you will work on with your website is Vulnerability Analysis ‚Äì Literature Review in Unit 2. Please read the 'house rules' below.

**You should only use the website allocated to you for the activities in this module.**

**There are a few 'house rules' for the use of the 'test sites' provided as part of the NS assessment.** Please read these carefully and adhere to them:

- These websites use the shared hosting model. Therefore, pings and IP-based testing will not provide any useful information. Please avoid pinging these sites.
- Do not carry out Denial of Service/Distributed Denial of Service attacks as due to the nature of the hosting, these attacks may disrupt other users.
- Remember that the point of the assessment is to test and detect vulnerabilities in a specific site - ALL websites (to a greater/ lesser degree) are vulnerable to DDoS attacks.
- You do not have admin or login access to these sites. Therefore, any social engineering attacks will need to be theoretical. They should still be considered as part of your assessment.
- The sites are built using the freely available Softaculous scripts. You should research these as part of your initial investigations.

Please ensure that you **do not post or store ANY personal data** on these test sites as they are not secure and not part of the University of Essex Online or Kaplan estate.
