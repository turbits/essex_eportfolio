## Module 2: Assignment 1: System Design

This assignment had a broad requirements set, not to mention that it does not explicitly state that, in the subsequent assignment, you will be building this system in Python using your design. Nontheless I did my best to interpret the requirements and create a system that meets them.

### 📝 Requirements

- The terms you have used to carry out your background research and the reasons for their inclusion. You should aim to draw out the attributes and operations for each of the classes and provide a rationale for your system design and any key choices made (500 words) (Criticality weighted at 25%, Application of Knowledge weighted at 25%)
- Create the following UML models to represent the design and operation of your system: (Structure and Presentation weighted at 25%)
  - Use case diagram
  - Activity diagram
  - Class diagram
  - Sequence diagram
  - State transition diagram
- Provision capability in your system to retain data within the following data structures: (Knowledge and Understanding weighted at 25%)
  - List
  - Stack **_(in Python (2 at least): a list that is treated in a LIFO manner)_**
  - Queue **_(I used deque)_**
  - Dictionary
- Two _required_ references:
