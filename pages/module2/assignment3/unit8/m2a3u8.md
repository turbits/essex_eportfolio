## Module 2: Assignment 3: Unit 8

For this unit, I did not have time to do the collaborative "portfolio" requirement, so I did some of the Codio activities instead. The collaborative requirements seem a bit unrealistic, considering nobody contributes to the discussions regardless and they require responses from other students. For example, for this unit, there was one post from a student for their requirement and no replies. The way the school site is structured probably also does not help with this (exceedingly unintuitive).
