### 📝 Requirements

This activity is as follows:

- Review the Codio module Class, Functions and Methods to help you better understand this week’s concepts. You can discuss your work with your tutor and save your results in your e-portfolio.
  - **_I did a bit of the "Codio activity - class, functions, and methods" page for this, see above table of contents._**
- Write a Python program to achieve basic employee-related functionality which includes retaining employee details and allowing an employee to book a day of annual leave. Extend the Python program you have now created to use protected and unprotected variables. Remember to record your findings in your e-portfolio.
  - **_This program is available in an external repository, see above table of contents._**
