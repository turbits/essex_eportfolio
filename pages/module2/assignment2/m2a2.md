## Module 2: Assignment 2: System Implementation

This assignment was to take the system design we did in [assignment 1](/pages/module2/assignment1/m2a1.html) and implement it in Python. We were required to use an unsupported version of Python, as we were also given a "Codio" environment, which had "2.7.15+" installed, which did not seem to work with Python 3 functions.

### 📝 Requirements

You will receive marks for unsuccessful answers if they build a logical argument. The deliverables for this assignment and the associated grading criteria (to be reviewed alongside the criteria grid in the Module Resources page) are:

- Python code, covering:
  - Code elegance – is the appropriate approach (techniques, algorithms etc.) used? and,
  - Meeting your chosen solution requirements (Knowledge and Understanding weighted at 30%).
  - Application of object-oriented programming features and,
  - Test data used to test the code. (Application of Knowledge and understanding weighted a 30%).
- Structure and Presentation (weighted at 30%) focuses on:
  - Comments on the code explaining it,
  - Your README file containing a description of the solution implemented and instructions on how to execute the code (600 words), and
  - How well you have organised your code.
- Please note that academic integrity also applies to codes, where all sources can be placed in the README file and/or as part of the code commentary. (Academic Integrity weighted at 10%)
- Remember to also record your responses in your e-portfolio.
  - **_I believe this means our 'development process' is to be included, which you will find in this folder (or the table of contents) in docx and markdown format._**

**_As a bonus, you can also read the requirements.md file in this folder, which I created to outline the requirements and how I met them (or failed to meet, in some cases)._**
