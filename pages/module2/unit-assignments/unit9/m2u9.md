## Activity 3: Cyclomatic Complexity of a Code Snippet

Q: What is the cyclomatic complexity of the following piece of code?

A: 3
The cyclomatic complexity of this piece of code is 3. There are three paths through the code; one for each if statement, and one for the default path (if neither if statement is true).

```csharp
public static string IntroducePerson(string name, int age)
{
    var response = $"Hi! My name is {name} and I'm {age} years old.";

    if (age >= 18)
        response += " I'm an adult.";

    if (name.Length > 7)
        response += " I have a long name.";

    return response;
}
```
