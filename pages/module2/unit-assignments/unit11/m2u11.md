# Unit 11: Pointers, References & Memory, and Design Patterns

This unit did not have specific activities for the e-portfolio other than to continue eportfolio updates.

I think spending hours on standing up jekyll and trying to get it to work with github pages (and due to version mismatches, modern jekyll versions not working with github pages, etc.) counts as contributing to the eportfolio. In the end, I could not get it working properly with github pages, and if you go around and look at GitHub comments and others writing articles on the internet it has always been an issue. The documentation on GitHub is lacking, and so is the Jekyll documentation.

So in the end, I set it up on my VPS. It is hosted at [https://essex.trevorwoodman.ca](https//essex.trevorwoodman.ca). I stood up nginx, created a server block, set up semi-automated build and deployment of the site using a bash script. The script still has to be run manually, I did not want to spend the time working on trying to make git hooks function, but eventually I will make it work with git hooks to automatically build and deploy the site on a `git push` to the repository.

Below you'll find the bash script.

## Deploy Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash -e

# github repo
REMOTE=https://github.com/turbits/essex_eportfolio.git
# temp dir to build repo
BUILDDIR=$HOME/staging_area
# server block where nginx looks for content to serve
WWW=/var/www/essex.trevorwoodman.ca/html
# backup folder in case of error
WWWBAK=$HOME/backup_html

# if err, revert to backup
function err_cleanup {
        echo "ERR: Reverting backup"
        rsync -aqz --del $WWWBAK/ $WWW
        rm -rf $BUILDDIR
}

# if err, call cleanup
trap cleanup EXIT

# explode builddir
rm -rf $BUILDDIR

# make backup of current site
rsync -aqz $WWW/ $WWWBAK

# clone from remote
git clone $REMOTE $BUILDDIR

# delete old version
rm -rf $WWW/*

# bundle install/build jekyll site/deploy to www
cd $BUILDDIR
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll build -d $WWW
cd ..

# explode builddir
rm -rf $BUILDDIR

# no errors - exit clean
trap - EXIT
```
