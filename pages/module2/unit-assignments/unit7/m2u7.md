## Requirements

You can complete one or more of the following activities for inclusion in your e-portfolio. You can also share your work with your tutor via the Tutor Channel for formative feedback.

1. Discuss the ways in which data structures support object-oriented development. Use examples of three different data structures to contextualise your response.
2. Create a nested dictionary of data on cars within a Car class. Extend the program to work with the dictionary by calling the following methods:

   - items()
   - keys()
   - values()

3. Read the article by Kampffmeyer & Zschaler (2007). Develop a program which allows a user to enter the properties which they require of a design pattern, and have the program make a recommendation. Your program should use a constructor to initialise attributes and assign values to variables based on input entered by the user.
