# Unit 3: UML

## Table of Contents

- üîó[Washing Machine State Diagram](#washing-machine-state-diagram)
- üîó[UML Reference Manual Screenshots](#uml-reference-manual-screenshots)

## Requirements

This activity is as follows:

- Discuss which UML models are most applicable at different stages of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  - **_I've skipped this, but I suppose the washing machine state diagram counts as an artefact_**
- Making reference to ‚ÄòThe Unified Modeling Language Reference Manual Second Edition‚Äô, use the State Machine Diagram in Figure 3-7 to design a similar model for a washing machine.
  - **_The referenced figure, Figure 3-7, is in fact not a state machine diagram, it is a component diagram, so I suspect that this was a typo. Figure 3-5 is a state machine diagram, so I will be using that as a basis instead. I've included an excerpt of pages 48-51 from the book [here](#uml-reference-manual-screenshots) to prove that. I've included my state machine diagram, "washing-machine-state-diagram.jpeg" in this folder, and below. Obviously it is a very basic implementation of a state machine, perhaps there are more than one rinse cycles, spin cycles, etc, but it shows the basis of what a washing machine state machine would look like._**
