# 👋Welcome

I'm Trevor Woodman, a student in the _University of Essex, Post Graduate Computer Science Degree_ program.

This ePortfolio is a repository of my code, reflective pieces, and other essays as required by several courses. The ePortfolio is a work in progress, and will be updated as I complete more modules and tinker with the site.
