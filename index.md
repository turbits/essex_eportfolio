## 👋Welcome

This is the ePortfolio of Trevor Woodman, I am a student in the _University of Essex, Post Graduate Computer Science Degree_ programme.

This ePortfolio is a repository of my code, reflective pieces, and other essays as required by several courses. The ePortfolio is a work in progress, and will be updated as I complete more modules.
