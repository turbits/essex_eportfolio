<h3 id="requirements-met">Requirements Met</h3>

<p>Because there is quite a bit of content in this assignment, I‚Äôve included the direct requirements and where the answers to these requirements can be found in the table of contents above.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The first requirement is an <em>artefact</em> from each unit 1-11, which are all under their individual unit folders (see table of contents above).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‚ÄúAn analysis of the data/information gathered in the module‚Äù, this requirement is met as part of the reflection piece.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‚ÄúYour evaluation of your final project in weeks 7 and 11‚Äù, this requirement is met as part of the reflection piece.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reflection piece available as a docx and as markdown, and is a 1000-word essay on the analysis of the module, the impact on my professional/personal development, and my work in the module. It also includes the above analysis and evaluations of my first (unit 7) and second (unit 11) assignments.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="-requirements">üìù Requirements</h3>

<p><strong>Assignment Details</strong></p>

<p>As a learning and development e-portfolio, specific requirements for what should be included in your e-portfolio are detailed in the ‚ÄúModule E-Portfolio Learning Activities‚Äù section. Elaborating on the requirements and the applicable grading criteria (please see the full outline on the Module Resources page), your e-portfolio should consist of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your answers to and outputs from exercises carried out during the module, including all your coding scripts and system designs. Aim to showcase at least 1 artefact from each unit. (Application of Knowledge and Understanding weighted at 10%, Independent working weighted at 10%)</li>
  <li>Your analysis of the data/information gathered in the module, as well as information from applicable contributions to the collaborative discussion forums (Application of Knowledge and Understanding weighted at 10%)</li>
  <li>Your evaluation of your final project in weeks 7 and 11 (Independent working weighted at 10%).</li>
  <li>Reflection on (Criticality weighted at 40%).
    <ul>
      <li>Object-Orientated Programming based on what you have learned in this module.</li>
      <li>Your work in the module.</li>
      <li>The impact on your professional/personal development.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It is expected that reflections will be written as you progress through the module, as listed above. The final reflective piece that you prepare, which might include components of the reflections that you have captured throughout the module is the piece which should be capped at 1,000 words.</p>

<p>You have the option of presenting your reflective piece as a video recording (with subtitles) or as written text. In writing the reflective content, some people find a diary-style approach helps. For example, you can use Rolfe et al.‚Äôs (2001) approach. You could start by providing a brief description of the project outcomes or critical incident (WHAT), analyse and interpret the information (SO WHAT) and then decide how you can use the information and learning from it (NOW WHAT). You can find out more about the structure of your reflection by visiting the e-portfolio page on the department site. Please note that your reflections are not seen by other students, so you are free to discuss what is relevant to your learning and the processes you have gone through.</p>

<p>If submitting a video reflection, remember that you will need to include comprehensive subtitles (in English). The video recording can consist of a series of video-logs recorded during the module, edited together to form a comprehensive video diary for final submission. Remember that this must flow as an integrated, comprehensive record of your experience on the module. If you choose to use a video format, you must also provide a transcript file and upload this into the submission portal below.</p>

<p>These are some exploratory questions to help you develop your reflection:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have you clearly described the topic of your project and the various aspects of project which are key to your reflection?</li>
  <li>Emotional Response and Analysis. Critically analyse yourself and your own behaviour during this project. How did working on the project make you feel? How did these emotions affect you and your work? Have you reviewed the views of others, your prior experience, and correctly referenced literature, in relation to your current behaviour and the work you‚Äôve done?</li>
  <li>Learning and Changed Actions. Show that you have thought deeply about what exactly produced your learning (or a new way of thinking) while taking this project.</li>
  <li>Do you have evidence of skills and knowledge developed through this project? Provide a clear description of your evidence of learning during this project and how you can apply (or have applied) them in a real-world experience.</li>
  <li>You will need to evidence and evaluate your individual contribution to a group project, completing tasks to the required standard. You will also need to demonstrate clear participation in the team activities as it informs your reflection. Legible screenshots from your e-portfolio are acceptable and will not affect your word count.</li>
  <li>Is there an accurate use of citations and references throughout this piece of work?‚ÄØHave you demonstrated the required integrity in‚ÄØyour‚ÄØsubmission?</li>
</ul>

<p>The strict word count limit for the e-portfolio applies to the reflection only - 1,000 words. (This also applies to your transcript should you want to use video elements.) The rest of your e-portfolio does not have a strict word count limit.</p>

<p>Your e-portfolio content should be presented in a structured, logical way. Remember, this will be marked and will contribute to your overall grade. If it makes no sense to you, or it appears cluttered, unstructured, and difficult to follow, it will appear the same to the tutors as well and that WILL affect your overall mark. (Structure and Presentation weighted at 10%). You will also be assessed on the correct use (and format) of citations and references in your e-portfolio (Academic Integrity weighted at 10%).</p>
