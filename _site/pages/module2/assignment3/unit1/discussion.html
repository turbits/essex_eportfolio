<p>Article: The Power of ePortfolio Development to Foster Reflective and Deeper Learning in an Online Graduate Adult Education Program</p>

<p>The aforementioned article is certainly a lengthy but interesting read. I found myself surprised at the amount of research that has been done regarding ePortfolios, and the possible benefits of using them in Graduate education programs. I personally know quite a few people in the tech industry (IT, programmers) and, to my knowledge, none of them have never needed or wanted to use an ePortfolio, and so I was interested to see what the article had to say about using them as a tool for something other than a portfolio of work. This is less of a discussion and more of a short critical piece. This article read like an institutional piece for post secondary schools to use to rationalize the use of ePortfolios in their programs to me. Personally, I believe ePortfolios to be a justification, albeit an understandable one, to push more of the actual learning and development onto the student. I understand that this is a bit of a cynical view, but the article comes off to me as a bit of a stretch overall in terms of the benefits of ePortfolios.</p>

<p>The article discusses the benefits of ePortfolios in a number of ways, but the most surprising and frankly debatable aspect was of the core idea of the article: deeper learning or some eventual prospect of developing into a more considerate or reflective individual. The article attempts to visually push this into the readers face via student quotes. The research presented seems to have been performed admirably, but has institutional undertones. I believe that a great many students have mock confidence in <em>any</em> post-secondary education, and they outwardly project that as manufactured positivity and reflection. I’m obviously not saying that this is the case for all students, far from it, but the idea that students at large are somehow gaining an entirely different world view and gaining altruistic mindsets from contributing to an ePortfolio is, in my opinion, a bit of a stretch.</p>

<p>To elaborate on this, let’s take a quote as an example that I found particularly romanticized: “By far the biggest surprise of this exercise was arriving at the realization that although I am a helper, I am far too complacent. I have come to recognize many of the inequalities and injustices in the world. I want very much to be an agent of change even if this means knocking over a few apple carts.” (Anon, 2021)</p>

<p>I find the mental gymnastics one has to perform arduous to think that a student, graduate level or not, could come to this conclusion solely from contributing to an ePortfolio. I would instead attribute this thought formation to more of their physical experience at a campus, the people they hold relationships with, the people they hold in high regard, the things they hear and internalise, and the environment they immerse themselves in, as a whole, not to mention who they are as a person regardless of these things. This would be far more realistic of a proposal and one I would agree to without hesitation.</p>

<p>In summary, I agree that ePortfolios are a most likely a good tool for students to use to reflect on their work and their learning, but this idea that they create an enlightening effect on a student is perhaps a bit outlandish. I believe that the latter is a result of a healthy combination of experiences and relationships that a student has, and not a result of a tool that they are often forced to use as part of their professional development.</p>
