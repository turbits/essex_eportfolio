<p>üëâ<a href="#my-reflection">My Reflection</a></p>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>

<p>Using the website(s) assigned to you in Unit 1, carry out the following exercise and answer the questions listed below.</p>

<p>Carry out a literature search/audit on software sites and the national vulnerabilities database to create a baseline audit on potential vulnerabilities with websites.</p>

<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Identify and analyse security threats and vulnerabilities in network systems and determine appropriate methodologies, tools and techniques to manage and/or solve them.</li>
  <li>Design and critically appraise computer programs and systems to produce solutions that help manage and audit risk and security issues.</li>
  <li>Gather and synthesise information from multiple sources (including internet security alerts and warning sites) to aid in the systematic analysis of security breaches and issues.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>

<p>Reflect on this activity by answering the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Did you have any issues or challenges with the literature search/audit on software sites and the national vulnerabilities database?</li>
  <li>How did you overcome them?</li>
  <li>How will they affect your final report?</li>
</ul>

<p>Record all reflections in your e-portfolio. Find guidance on creating a GitHub accout and e-Portfolio in the Module Resources tab.</p>

<h2 id="my-reflection">My Reflection</h2>

<p>The website I was assigned (that I chose) was https://copperplate.org.uk. The task was to create a baseline audit on potential vulnerabilities with, I‚Äôm assuming websites in general, based on the unfortunately ambiguous wording. That being said, these are the steps that I would take to create a baseline audit on a target with potential vulnerabilities:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Literature Search
    <ul>
      <li>Conduct literature search on most common web vulnerabilities.</li>
      <li>Research academic journals, research papers, and other credible sources such as the Insitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).</li>
      <li>Focus reasearch on web application security, common vulnerabilities, secure coding practices, web security best practices, and web security standards.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>National Vulnerabilities Database (NVD)
    <ul>
      <li>Conduct a search on the National Vulnerabilities Database (NVD)</li>
      <li>Search for vulnerabilities related to the target‚Äôs tech stack; in my case this was Coppermine Gallery, Softaculous, jQuery, etc.</li>
      <li>In the case of https://copperplate.org.uk, there were vulnerabilities, many high and one critical, but none of them applied to the assumed version that the target was running.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Software Sites
    <ul>
      <li>Conduct research on software that the website was running</li>
      <li>Attempt to locate and review any public code repositories to find possible attack vectors or vulnerabilities</li>
      <li>Review security advisories, bug reports, changelogs, and other documentation to find possible attack vectors or vulnerabilities</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Web Security Best Practices
    <ul>
      <li>Study web security best practices from credible sources such as the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</li>
      <li>Attempt to identify any non-compliance, such as insecure coding if code is available, validation issues, proper authentication and session management, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The information that I gathered to form a potential audit baseline was educational, and I learned quite a bit concerning security standards (NIST CSF) and regulation (GDPR). I cannot say the same for the proposed ‚Äútarget‚Äù websites that we were provided as part of the course and the assignments for writing a vulnerability assessment and executive summary for them. I touched on this in my final assignment, my <a href="/pages/module4/assignment3/m4a3.html">Reflective Piece</a>, but in my opinion the course would have been better served by a simple capture-the-flag type of scenario that is readily available from websites such as <a href="https://www.hackthebox.com/hacker/ctf">Hack The Box</a>, <a href="https://pentesterlab.com/">PentesterLab</a>, and <a href="https://defendtheweb.net/">Defend the Web</a>. I feel that this would have been a better use of time and resources, and would have provided a more realistic and practical experience for students, rather than ‚Äúhere is a generic website you don‚Äôt have access to and are not allowed to run exploitative testing on‚Äù.</p>

<p>To directly answer the questions posed in the assignment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q: Did you have any issues or challenges with the literature search/audit on software sites and the national vulnerabilities database?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A: No, I did not have any issues with this specifically; the database and related software sites for my particular target were easy to find and research.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q: How did you overcome them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A: See first answer. I did not have any issues finding or utilising any applicable resources, including the NVD and software sites (such as the public <a href="https://github.com/coppermine-gallery/cpg1.6.x">repo</a> for Coppermine Gallery 1.6.x)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q: How will they affect your final report?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A: See previous answer.</p>
