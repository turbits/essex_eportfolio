<h2 id="-unit-1-collab-discussion-digitalisation">üìù Unit 1: Collab Discussion: Digitalisation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>What are the security implications of the digital economy?</li>
</ul>

<p>My answer is available <a href="#my-initial-post">here</a></p>

<h3 id="discussion-topic">Discussion Topic</h3>

<p>Read Wei et al. (2019) and Spremic and Simunic (2018) and then post a message that reflects your thoughts and responses to the questions below. You should support your arguments with appropriate academic references.</p>

<p>In your responses, consider the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is a ‚Äòfully digital enterprise‚Äô?</li>
  <li>What are the cyber Security challenges/concerns with a fully digital enterprise?</li>
  <li>What are the cyber security challenges for a bricks and mortar SME wanting to become a digital enterprise?</li>
  <li>Do you agree with the views expressed, especially in light of the ‚Äòenergy crisis‚Äô experienced worldwide in 2022?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Identify and analyse security threats and vulnerabilities in network systems and determine appropriate methodologies, tools and techniques to manage and/or solve them.</li>
  <li>Articulate the legal, social, ethical and professional issues faced by information security and risk professionals.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="discussion-guidance">Discussion Guidance</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Your initial posting should respond to the question and be at least 200 words long. This should be labelled as ‚ÄòInitial Post‚Äô</li>
  <li>You will then respond to at least 2 of your peers‚Äô posts in Unit 2 (each labelled as ‚ÄòPeer Response‚Äô). To guide your responses, look at the guidelines for the peer review process on the department‚Äôs home page. Focus on the possible measures that could have been put in place in order to prevent the incidents highlighted by your peers.  Please try to limit your response posts to 200-300 words maximum, so that others may be encouraged to reflect on, and respond to your ideas.</li>
  <li>In Unit 3, you should provide a summary post based on your initial post, the feedback from your peers and the content of the three units. Please label this as ‚ÄòSummary Post‚Äô. It should be 300 words.</li>
  <li>Referencing: When you have referred to other authors thoughts, ideas and opinions in your posts, you must reference the author as you would in an academic assignment using the UoEO Harvard reference style.</li>
  <li>You will be not be assessed on your contribution to this forum throughout the module, but the tutor will post group feedback via a module announcement.</li>
  <li>This activity forms a component of your e-portfolio which you should continue to build throughout your programme. All e-portfolio activities are intended to demonstrate your ability and strengths through evidence and reflection.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="my-initial-post">My Initial Post</h3>

<p>A ‚Äú(fully) digital enterprise‚Äù is never explicitly defined in the article, but it can be defined as an organisation that holistically employs technology to improve every aspect of its operations. This is not digitisation that is limited to an IT department, but digitisation that encompasses how every member or employee operates in some fashion. The idea of a fully digital enterprise is enticing as it allows for unmatched efficiency, automation, and scalability. However, this level of digitisation also comes with a significant amount of risk.</p>

<p>A very important aspect of a fully digital enterprise that is not readily apparent is the management of both homogenous and disparate systems. Who, or what, is managing the systems, and how are they being managed? According to Johnson Service Group, a long-standing North American staffing agency, approximately 63% of companies have IT departments that are understaffed (Bennett, 2021). An acceptable option to manage these systems is via some bespoke aggregate tool, pulling every system into a centralised control centre and perhaps utilising software such as Prometheus and Ansible. Unfortunately, this option has the side effect of adding more responsibilities and required development time to the already understaffed and overworked IT department. Another, and often ideal option, is to simply outsource the management, usually via paid support tiers. A couple of examples are Crowdstrike‚Äôs ‚ÄúOverwatch‚Äù or Arctic Wolf‚Äôs ‚ÄúConcierge Security Team‚Äù; both teams are outsourced and highly specialised, and they will actively monitor and triage issues in your environment, for a price.</p>

<p>A more classic small to medium enterprise that is looking to expand into digitalisation faces a number of challenges, both from a human perspective and from a technical perspective. Obvious technical challenges include the setup and maintenance of systems and networks, which is becoming increasingly specialised as technologies such as hyperconverged infrastructure become more popular and readily accessible. Probably the most important human challenge would be the mandated and quality education and training of the existing IT department which, again, would be adding more stress and responsibilities to what is most likely an already understaffed and overworked group of people.</p>

<p>The article ‚ÄúDigital Innovation: Creating the Utility of the Future‚Äù by Wei et al. (2019), describes a utopian utility company of the future. While I do agree that utilities are, of course, expanding into renewable sources of energy and becoming more digital, the article does suggest idealism, even at the time. Given the ongoing energy crisis that began in 2021, a year after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, several nations have been forced to do such things as restart coal plants. Food, water, fuel, electricity, and many other commodities are rising dramatically in price. The energy crisis cannot be directly attributed, but the economic rebound shortly after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic was a contributing factor, as is the ongoing invasion of Ukraine by Russia. In particular, the severe geopolitical consequences that followed Russia‚Äôs invasion. The reliance on Russia for oil, gas, and coal by several nations particularly in Europe, (which previously included the UK), is substantial. A favourable result is the potential for a rapid shift from traditional fuel sources such as coal, natural gas, and crude, to much cleaner and efficient sources such as nuclear, wind, and solar, especially as the costs associated with wind and solar are swiftly reducing.</p>
