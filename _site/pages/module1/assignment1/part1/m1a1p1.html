<p><strong>Assignment Description: Data Structures and Algorithm Design</strong></p>

<p>One of the core skills that you should have as a computing professional is your ability to design and implement algorithms using a programming language. For this assignment, you will develop an application that will be used to perform our day-to-day actions. It may include, but not be limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A phone book</li>
  <li>A contact book</li>
  <li>A bank account book</li>
  <li>Personal skill record book</li>
  <li>A record book of your interests and related resources</li>
</ul>

<p>You may select an application that is relevant to you. You may reach out to your tutor for approval.</p>

<p><strong>Assignment Requirements:</strong></p>

<p>Note that the associated grading criteria are highlighted in the requirements below, to be reviewed alongside the criteria grid (Module Resources).</p>

<ol>
  <li>A brief outline of the application (Knowledge and Understanding weighted at 10%):
    <ul>
      <li>Define the objective and purpose of the selected application.</li>
      <li>Outline the instructions of how the application is to be executed.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Design of data structure and algorithms (Knowledge and Understanding weighted at 20%, Application of Knowledge and Understanding weighted at 20%, Structure and Presentation weighted at 20%):
    <ul>
      <li>Define and show the data structures used in this application. Use diagrams to show the steps where necessary. Data structures may include:
        <ul>
          <li>Insertion</li>
          <li>Deletion</li>
          <li>Sorting</li>
          <li>Searching</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Describe the algorithms using flowchart/pseudocode that you have used for this application. You may have multiple algorithms to show your logic and make sure you demonstrate them using flowcharts/pseudocode.</li>
      <li>It is recommended that you build your functions to execute the tasks and avoid using specialised functions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Test plan (Application of Knowledge and Understanding weighted at 10%, Structure and Presentation weighted at 10% ):
    <ul>
      <li>Identify the checkpoints that you would like to test and outline a test plan indicating the range of data you will be using.</li>
      <li>Outline the expected test results</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Please note that academic integrity applies to your development where all sources should be clearly and correctly cited and referenced. (Academic Integrity weighted at 10%)</p>

<p><strong>Assignment Guidance</strong></p>

<p>Submit a single document outlining your responses to sections 1, 2 and 3. Your report should include your rationale and necessary diagrams and tables.
You will receive marks for unsuccessful answers if they build a logical argument.</p>
