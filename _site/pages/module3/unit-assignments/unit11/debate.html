<h1 id="unit-11-future-trends-in-secure-software-development-debate---microservices-and-microkernels">Unit 11: Future Trends in Secure Software Development: Debate - Microservices and Microkernels</h1>

<p>Instead of posting to the forum, I have included my response below. Unfortunately, again the quality of the course suffers, the line “The forum has a message that says: ‘Torvalds has been proven wrong and it only took nearly thirty years. Microservices and microkernels are the future.’” is untrue, there is no post as such. There is also no reading material that it is in reference to. I have answered the question with just the quote provided.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<p>Read Appendix A: the Tanenbaum-Torvalds debate in DiBona &amp; Ockman (1999) then read Fritzsch et al (2019).</p>

<p>The forum has a message that says: “Torvalds has been proven wrong and it only took nearly thirty years. Microservices and microkernels are the future. “</p>
<ul>
  <li>On the forum post a message either agreeing or disagreeing with the above and give a justification (ideally with an academic reference) supporting your view.</li>
  <li>Outside the forum, discuss your positions in your team and come up with a team stance. This should be shared in Unit 12.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Critically analyse development problems and determine appropriate methodologies, tools and techniques (including program design and development) to solve them.</li>
  <li>Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real-life perspectives on team roles and organisation.</li>
</ul>

<p>I disagree with the statement and I believe it is a bit of a stretch to say that Torvalds has been proven wrong. Microservices and microkernels have transformed the way software is developed, and enabled such things as cloud computing, but they are not the <em>best</em> way to develop software, as the statement implies. Software is complex and requires a significant amount of design and proper planning to produce a good product. Microservices and microkernels are not a panacea, they are an option. It is important to consider all options when designing software and to choose the best option for the problem(s) at hand.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, the Tanenbaum-Torvalds debate was simply an argument by two personalities that would have enjoyed being correct over the other, so should hold no real sway in the realm of good software development.</p>
