<p>My answers to follow. Unfortunately, the ‚Äúarticle‚Äù is not in the Unit 10 reading list but I did manage to find it in the module resources reading list link; apparently the ‚Äúarticle‚Äù is from Unit 12. The article title is ‚ÄúFaceted Dynamic Information Flow via Control and Data Monads‚Äù by Schmitz et al (2016), and is available <a href="http://kennknowles.com/research/schmitz-rhodes-austin-knowles-flanagan.post.16.faceted.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you think this is a good approach to protect systems from data leakage? What are the pros and cons?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article outlines an approach of separating the policy enforcement from the code execution and tracks data flow between program and policy variables.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The separation of concerns between policy and code execution appears to be a logical and effective approach</li>
  <li>It allows policy makers to focus solely on policy without worrying about code execution, and vice versa for programmers</li>
  <li>It has the potential to allow for more dynamic and robust policy enforcement</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The approach adds significant complexity to the system, which may be difficult to efficiently manage</li>
  <li>This separation, although a good idea in theory, may be difficult to implement in practice</li>
  <li>Developers would be required to be familiar with policy language which may require training</li>
  <li>Given its complexity, it could add significant performance overhead</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Create a basic outline design of how you would create such a system in Python.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would define an outline for a system as such:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Define the policy language; this should be a language that is easy to understand and implement, and something that both the policy makers and developers could easily understand. This could be as simple as using a language like YAML or XML, or something more complex like creating a domain-specific language (DSL) that is specific to the system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create policy enforcement; A system to enforce policy during runtime. I would most likely use a set of decorators for this as they are quite familiar to a developer and are easily understood as to their purpose. The decorators would wrap functions and methods, and enforce policy on the data that is being passed to them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Data monad; A system that tracks the data flow throughout the program.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Control monad; A system that tracks the control flow of the program.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Testing; The system would require extensive, robust, and ideally automated testing to ensure that the policies are being correctly enforced in the system.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
