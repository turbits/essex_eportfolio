<p>The International Space Station (ISS) is the product of a multi-national project of the largest structure humans have ever built in space. The ISS is in low-earth orbit and, on average, hosts an international crew of seven people (NASA, 2023). The estimated average of mission-related data handled on the Space Network is approximately 28TB daily (Jacobson &amp; Hume, 2017).</p>

<h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>

<p>To facilitate and securely store mission data coming from the ISS, the programme has contracted Team Transparency to develop a prototype for a system that will provide a secure repository for data transmitted from the ISS to ground stations owned and operated by members of the ISS programme. This system has been given the moniker ‚ÄúIDA‚Äù, ISS Data Archive.</p>

<h3 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h3>

<p>This document assumes the highest standard of both physical and cyber security. Ground stations are physically secured, e.g., personnel and systems are used in conjunction with strict identity verification. Networks and systems at the ground stations are secured, hardened, and maintained.</p>

<h3 id="user-roles">User Roles</h3>

<p>User:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Can read records</li>
  <li>Can update records</li>
</ul>

<p>Admin:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In addition to User permissions:
    <ul>
      <li>Can delete records and users</li>
      <li>Can edit users</li>
      <li>Can view the event logs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="software-specification">Software Specification</h3>

<p>Mission-related data is encrypted using Fernet encryption and a shared key prior to being transported via the Space Network down to a base station, where it is decrypted by IDA and stored on-site.</p>

<p>The IDA prototype is comprised of Flask running the backend and web server and a simple GUI frontend using HTML and CSS. The data is stored in a SQLite database and communicated with via a bespoke API written using Flask.</p>

<p>The ISS microservice crafts random ‚Äúrecord‚Äù objects to be then sent to the ‚Äú/records‚Äù endpoint on IDA at a given interval. The endpoint processes the data stream, decrypts the incoming ISS data using Fernet symmetric encryption with a known shared key between the ISS and the IDA system, and stores the data in the local SQLite database.</p>

<p>The frontend comprises a handful of interfaces: home, login, records, users, and logs. Users must authenticate to access the application. All authenticated users can create and read data via this interface. Admins can also edit and delete records and users and view the event logs.</p>

<p>Event logging is threaded, processing all events and keeping a separate table that is viewable by admins only. Event logs are meant to be immutable and there exists no endpoints or functions to modify or delete logs. This is not a full immutable solution, as the database could still be manually modified or deleted.</p>

<h3 id="software-design">Software Design</h3>

<h4 id="frontend">Frontend</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Users can authenticate against a web interface to access the application</li>
  <li>Admins can edit and delete records and users via the interface</li>
  <li>Admins have access to two secured views: users and logs</li>
  <li>The frontend is minimal and responsive, using HTML, CSS, and minimal JS</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="backend">Backend</h4>

<ul>
  <li>A bespoke and robust REST API facilitates backend operations</li>
  <li>User input is validated and sanitised server-side to protect against injection-based attacks</li>
  <li>All actions will be logged and are immutable, even by admins</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="system-requirements">System Requirements</h3>

<p>The system is platform-agnostic; it is compatible with any platform that can run Python 3.11.</p>

<p>Resource requirements vary on the amount of data being processed by the application, and how many users are requesting data from the database at a time.</p>

<p>These are baseline requirements, with heavier usage requiring more resources:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2GHz or faster multi-core processor</li>
  <li>2GB of RAM</li>
  <li>10GB of storage</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="quality-assurance-and-testing">Quality Assurance and Testing</h3>

<h4 id="usability">Usability</h4>

<p>IDA from a user perspective is intuitive and minimalistic. The UI contains few interfaces.</p>

<h4 id="maintainability">Maintainability</h4>

<p>The code is well formed and commented where necessary. Functions, variables, classes, models, and other items and objects are clearly named, and their purpose is easily understood.</p>

<h4 id="scalability">Scalability</h4>

<p>The IDA prototype is built using Python 3.11 and SQLite and uses few libraries. The libraries in use are tested and proven. The web server and database can be swapped out for more robust options.</p>

<h4 id="reliability">Reliability</h4>

<p>Testing and robust error-checking will help with reliability of IDA; as will focusing on simplicity of the microservices and the API.</p>

<h4 id="portability">Portability</h4>

<p>IDA is platform-agnostic and can be set up to run anywhere Python 3.11 will run.</p>

<h3 id="security-concerns-and-mitigation">Security Concerns and Mitigation</h3>

<h4 id="privacy-and-gdpr">Privacy and GDPR</h4>

<p>Personal information used is limited to first name, last name, and username. These data points would have been collected and a privacy policy signed as part of employment by the ISS programme.</p>

<p>Under GDPR, these data points would fall under one or more of the following articles: Article 6(1)(a) through Article 6(1)(f) (GDPR.EU, no date).</p>
