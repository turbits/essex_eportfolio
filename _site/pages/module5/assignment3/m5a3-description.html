<h2 id="module-5-assignment-3-end-of-module-assignment---individual-eportfolio---assignment-description">Module 5: Assignment 3: End of Module Assignment - Individual ePortfolio - Assignment Description</h2>

<p>The final assessment in this module is an e-Portfolio that collates all the evidence of your work in this module and accounts for 40% of the overall module mark. Submit by the end of Unit 12.</p>

<p><strong>Assignment Details</strong></p>

<p>As a learning and development e-Portfolio, specific requirements for what should be included in your e-Portfolio are detailed in the “Module e-Portfolio” section. Elaborating on the requirements and the applicable grading criteria (please see the full outline on the Module Resources page), your e-portfolio should consist of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All e-portfolio/reflective activities provided in the module. Aim to showcase at least 1 artefact from each unit. (Application of Knowledge weighted at 10%, Independent working weighted at 10%)</li>
  <li>All statistics exercises you have completed throughout this module, including those from the mandatory worksheets in Units 8 and 9. (Application of Knowledge weighted at 10%)</li>
  <li>Your evaluation of your Literature Review and Research Proposal submissions (Independent working weighted at 10%)</li>
  <li>Reflections on (Criticality weighted at 40%):
    <ul>
      <li>your statistical analysis skills.</li>
      <li>the research methods process based on your learning in this module</li>
      <li>the impact on your personal/professional experience based on your completed professional skills matrix and any associated SWOT Analysis and/or Action Plan.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It is expected that reflections will be written as you progress through the module, as listed above. The final reflective piece that you prepare, which might include components of the reflections that you have captured throughout the module is the piece which should be capped at 1,000 words.</p>

<p>You have the option of presenting your reflective piece as a video recording (with subtitles) or as written text. In writing the reflective content, some people find a diary-style approach helps. For example, you can use Rolfe et al.’s (2001) approach. You could start by providing a brief description of the project outcomes or critical incident (WHAT), analyse and interpret the information (SO WHAT) and then decide how you can use the information and learning from it (NOW WHAT). You can find out more about the structure of your reflection by visiting the e-portfolio page on the department site. Please note that your reflections are not seen by other students, so you are free to discuss what is relevant to your learning and the processes you have gone through.</p>

<p>If submitting a video reflection, remember that you will need to include comprehensive subtitles (in English). The video recording can consist of a series of video-logs recorded during the module, edited together to form a comprehensive video diary for final submission. Remember that this must flow as an integrated, comprehensive record of your experience on the module. If you choose to use a video format, you must also provide a transcript file and upload this into the submission portal below.</p>

<p>These are some exploratory questions to help you develop your reflection:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Have you clearly described the topic of your project and the various aspects of project which are key to your reflection?</li>
  <li>Emotional Response and Analysis. Critically analyse yourself and your own behaviour during this project.  How did working on the project make you feel?  How did these emotions affect you and your work?  Have you reviewed the views of others, your prior experience, and correctly referenced literature, in relation to your current behaviour and the work you’ve done?</li>
  <li>Learning and Changed Actions. Show that you have thought deeply about what exactly produced your learning (or a new way of thinking) while taking this project.</li>
  <li>Do you have evidence of skills and knowledge developed through this project?  Provide a clear description of your evidence of learning during this project and how you can apply (or have applied) them in a real-world experience.</li>
  <li>You will need to evidence and evaluate your individual contribution to a group project, completing tasks to the required standard.  You will also need to demonstrate clear participation in the team activities as it informs your reflection. Legible screenshots from your e-portfolio are acceptable and will not affect your word count.</li>
  <li>Is there an accurate use of citations and references throughout this piece of work? Have you demonstrated the required integrity in your submission?</li>
</ul>

<p>The strict word count limit for the e-portfolio applies to the reflection only - 1,000 words (This also applies to your transcript should you want to use video elements.).  The rest of your e-portfolio does not have a strict word count limit.</p>

<p>Your e-portfolio content should be presented in a structured, logical way. Remember, this will be marked and will contribute to your overall grade. If it makes no sense to you, or it appears cluttered, unstructured, and difficult to follow, it will appear the same to the tutors as well and that WILL affect your overall mark. (Structure and Presentation weighted at 10%). You will also be assessed on the correct use (and format) of citations and references in your e-portfolio (Academic Integrity weighted at 10%).</p>

<p><strong>Further instructions</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Once you are ready to submit, create a branch of this module section in your e-portfolio. Guidance on how to create branches, as well as configuring sources for your GitHub Pages site, is covered in GitHub Documents. Please ensure you do not make any changes to this branch after the submission deadline as changes will not be acknowledged or marked.</li>
  <li>Submit a copy of your reflection (MS Word or pdf) to the submission portal below</li>
  <li>Be sure to include the web page address of your e-portfolio in the document, placed as the header or title of the document.</li>
