<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Discussion Topic: Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct
Pick a case study from the examples provided by the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM).</p>

  <p>Review the application of the ethics code to the situation described and highlight the impact on any relevant legal (jurisdictional or non-jurisdictional) and social issues, as well as on the professionalism of the computing professionals involved. You should provide comparisons to the British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct.</p>

  <p>You should demonstrate that you understand the topic covered and ensure you use references to academic literature (including journals, books, and reports). This activity will provide evidence of your personal growth and your summary post is required in your e-portfolio.</p>

  <p>Your initial posting should respond to the question and be at least 200 words long. Your initial post should be labelled ‚Äúinitial post‚Äù.</p>

  <p>Remember to save this to your e-portfolio.</p>

<p><strong><em>Case: Malware Disruption</em></strong></p>

<p>Rogue‚Äôs activities immediately raised jurisdictional issues; Rogue, based in a country with inadequate laws to regulate their hosting activities, was essentially free to continue their activities and to strongly resist international efforts to intervene. This is still a problem today, and highlights ongoing difficulty in addressing cybercrime when perpetrators are based in jurisdictions with limited legal frameworks or other jurisdictional issues such as state-sponsorship or transnationality. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), 13% of countries, including Belarus, Belgium, and Libya, have no cybercrime legislation (UNCTAD, 2021).</p>

<p>While Rogue‚Äôs pledge of ‚Äúguaranteed uptime, no matter what‚Äù is a strong selling point, it is also a strong indicator that they did not consider the ethics surrounding it. Rogue‚Äôs effort to resist requests to remove malicious actors from their service shows that they were not concerned with the impact of their actions on the public or their customers that were conducting legitimate activities. Rogue‚Äôs actions directly breached the BCS Code of Conduct, specifically the following principles: 1.a, 1.b, 2.f, 3.a, and 4.a through 4.d (BCS, 2022). We can clearly see that Rogue‚Äôs actions were not in the public interest and that they did not consider the impact of their actions on the public, on their customers, or on the industry as a whole. Moreover, they conducted their business without considering professionalism or international law.</p>

<p>While the professionalism of Rogue Services was lacking, the computing professionals involved in the halting of Rogue‚Äôs malicious compliance with their own private interest certainly showed as much. After many attempts to resolve the issue without force, security vendors and government organizations created a purpose-built, high-quality malware package to minimize collateral damage and to ensure that the malware would only target Rogue‚Äôs infrastructure. The actions of the computing professionals aligns with the entirety of the BCS Code of Conduct: Public Interest, Professional Competence and Integrity, Duty to Relevant Authority, and Duty to the Profession (BCS, 2022). The computing professionals involved in the disruption of Rogue‚Äôs malicious activities were clearly concerned with the public interest, the ethics surrounding the situation and their actions, and they conducted themselves in a professional manner, with integrity, and with due diligence to the relevant authorities.</p>

<p>A takeaway consideration of ethics surrounding malware use is vigilantism. In the above example, some parties would consider their actions vigilantism. They were using malware as a tool to remove a malicious actor. Regardless of BCS principles or laws their actions fit the definition. Would using malware for the public interest in a similar manner to the Rogue Services situation, but in a manner that would breach several BCS principles, be acceptable? A recent incident in 2021 involved a vigilante using malware to modify the hosts file on computers to prevent the user from navigating to malicious websites (Brandt, 2021). The actions of the actor involved were unethical and illegal, but ultimately considered the public interest and the greater good. This incident highlights the importance of ethics in computing and the need for computing professionals and other individuals to deeply consider the impact of their actions on the public and the industry as a whole.</p>
