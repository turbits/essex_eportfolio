<p><em>The Impact of Communication Technology on Employee Productivity During Government Mandated Lockdown in Canada</em></p>

<h3 id="1-what-is-the-focus-and-aim-of-your-review-who-is-your-audience">1. What is the focus and aim of your review? Who is your audience?</h3>

<p>The focus of my review is to examine the relationship between communication technology and productivity in the workplace in the context of government-mandated lockdowns in Canada. I aim to explore how various communications technologies, such as video and tele-conferencing, instant messaging platforms, project management software, VoIP and PBX phone systems, email, and other technologies have impacted employee productivity level during the COVID-19 pandemic. The intended audience for this literature review includes academics, researchers, policy makers, and professionals interesting in the intersection of communication technology and productivity in the Canadian labour force.</p>

<h3 id="2-why-is-there-a-need-for-your-review-why-is-it-significant">2. Why is there a need for your review? Why is it significant?</h3>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the Canadian labour force. As a result of the pandemic, many organizations have been forced to adapt to a remote work environment. This has resulted in a significant increase in the use of communication technologies to facilitate remote work. The impact of this shift in the workplace has been unprecendented, and it is important to understand how this shift has impacted employee productivity. This literature review will provide insight into the topic, and will help to inform future research on the topic.</p>

<h3 id="3-what-is-the-context-of-the-topic-or-issue-what-perspective-do-you-take-what-framework-do-you-use-to-synthesise-the-literature">3. What is the context of the topic or issue? What perspective do you take? What framework do you use to synthesise the literature?</h3>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic pressured countries, governments, businesses, and individuals into adopting compltely new lifestyles and ways of working. The context of this particular review pertains to the affect it had on the Canadian workforce.</p>

<h3 id="4-how-did-you-locate-and-select-sources-for-the-inclusion-in-the-review">4. How did you locate and select sources for the inclusion in the review?</h3>

<p>To locate and select sources for inclusion in my review I used Google Search Engine and Google Scholar, JSTOR.org, and various Government of Canada websites. Reoccurring terms that I used were ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù, ‚ÄúCOVID-19‚Äù, ‚Äúemployee productivity‚Äù, ‚Äúcommunication technology‚Äù, ‚Äúremote work‚Äù, ‚Äúwork from home‚Äù. For specific touch-points such as referencing statistics, I always attempted to find the source from the organization first, then using a trusted news source if the information was not available from the organization.</p>
