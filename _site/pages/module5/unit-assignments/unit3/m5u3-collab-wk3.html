<h2 id="summary-post">Summary Post</h2>

<p><strong><em>Case Study: Malware Disruption</em></strong></p>

<p>In my initial post, I delved into the ethical considerations and impact of the actions of parties involved in the Malware Disruption case study. I highlighted the ethical, legal, and principle based considerations, and why I believed that the actions of the computing professionals were not just ethical or lawful, but also necessary. I also brought to attention the importance of considering the impact of ones actions on the public, the difference between private and public interest, and the balance of what I would consider ethical and unethical actions as they pertained to the study.</p>

<p>After review of my peers‚Äô posts, one of them on this same case study, it is clear that ethics is a very deep and complex issue and certainly not to be overlooked. Rogue Services‚Äô conduct in the case study highlighted a number of ethical issues, and the responses from my peers provided insight into the subjectivity of ethics, and why it is important to deliberate on proposed actions and their intended and unintended consequences. The case study itself was an excellent and interesting example of the complexity of ethics, and the importance of considering the ethical implications of ones actions. The initial post by Hamad, A. (Hamad, 2023) contradicted my own beliefs on the study, and was enlightening to read.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I find myself recognizing the multifaceted nature of cybersecurity, ethics, and the interplay between technology, ethics, law, and public interest. Our discourse in the forum has underscored the challenges of ethics, and the importance of acknowledging that ethics is considerably complex; such so that even the most well-intentioned actions that have had a favourable outcome can be considered unethical by some. While the British Computer Society outlines a very clear and concise code of conduct (BCS, n.d.), even this code can be interpreted differently by individuals. To properly consider the ethical implications of ones actions, I believe that a consensus must be reached by two or, ideally, more parties to solidify that the planned actions are ethical and in the public interest.</p>
