<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Amidst the fervour of the computing revolution, we embark on a mission - the creation of a ground-breaking computing system: the Synputer. In this proposal, we take a step through the looking glass, and see up-close the design, development, and testing processes, and a thorough deep dive into the materials and pricing structure that will position the Synputer as a must-have premium product.</p>

<h2 id="methodology-section">Methodology Section</h2>
<h3 id="development-methodologies-overview">Development Methodologies Overview</h3>
<p>In software and hardware development, choosing the right methodology is pivotal. Two prominent methodologies, Waterfall and Agile, offer distinct approaches.</p>

<h4 id="waterfall">Waterfall</h4>
<p>A structured, sequential approach suitable for projects with stable requirements (Lientz &amp; Swanson, 1980).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Advantages: Clear documentation, defined milestones.</li>
  <li>Disadvantages: Limited flexibility for changing requirements, late-stage surprises.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="agile">Agile</h4>
<p>An iterative, adaptable approach emphasizing customer collaboration (Beck et al., 2001).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Advantages: Adaptability to changing requirements, frequent deliveries, stakeholder engagement.</li>
  <li>Disadvantages: Requires active collaboration, not suitable for all projects.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="justification-for-agile-approach">Justification for Agile Approach</h3>
<p>We choose Agile for the Synputer Development Project due to its adaptability to evolving technology and changing requirements (Highsmith &amp; Cockburn, 2001).</p>

<h2 id="gherkin-specifications">Gherkin Specifications</h2>
<p>See <strong>APPENDIX A</strong></p>

<p>These Gherkin specifications provide a clear and structured way to define the expected behaviour of the system based on the identified key requirements. THey will assist in development, testing, and valdiation phases of key feature sets in the Synputer.</p>

<h2 id="project-plan">Project Plan</h2>
<h3 id="budget-allocation">Budget Allocation</h3>
<p>The Synputer Development Project operates within a strict budget of ¬£500,000, with no exceeding until income is generated from machine sales. Budget allocation is as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Materials (¬£250,000): Procurement of components, software licenses, and materials essential for Synputer development.</li>
  <li>Labour (¬£200,000): Salaries for the development team and QA personnel, ensuring top talent for the project.</li>
  <li>Overhead (¬£50,000): Covers additional expenses such as utilities, facility costs, and administration to support the project.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remaining Budget: ¬£0 (Strict adherence to budget constraints)</p>

<h3 id="milestones-and-constraints">Milestones and Constraints</h3>
<ul>
  <li>First Major Prototype: Scheduled for completion one year before the product release, allowing ample time for testing and refinement.</li>
  <li>EDC Purchase (2,000 Unit	s): EDC‚Äôs commitment to purchase 2,000 units before the product release, a significant opportunity and constraint.</li>
  <li>Product Release by January 1984: Firm deadline set by Syn, ensuring the project‚Äôs maximum timeline of approximately 13 months.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pricing-strategy-and-revenue-generation">Pricing Strategy and Revenue Generation</h3>
<p>Detailed pricing strategies and considerations, as well as revenue generation projections, are provided in the Appendix B and Appendix C respectively.</p>

<p>The order to EDC will be for the agreed upon amount of 2000 units at ¬£250 each.</p>

<p>Given requirements, component cost, salaries, and licenses, the projected initial unit cost of the Synputer will be approximately ¬£200.</p>

<p>The Commodore 64‚Äôs rough price tag of ¬£300-¬£350 set it up as a viable personal computer that many households could afford. We believe a similar aggressive pricing strategy will be beneficial to the Synputer, and so our initial unit price will be set at ¬£300. This target may fluctuate before release based on our pricing strategy including price testing as well as the industry and economy closer to date.</p>

<h2 id="testing-strategy">Testing Strategy</h2>
<h3 id="testing-times-allocation">Testing Times Allocation</h3>
<p>Testing times have been allocated to various phases based on their complexity and criticality:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Longer testing cycles (2-week sprints) for hardware development due to assembly intricacies.</li>
  <li>Shorter cycles (1-week sprints) for software development to facilitate rapid prototyping and testing.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="types-of-testing">Types of Testing</h3>
<p>Multiple types of testing will be conducted to ensure product quality:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unit testing to validate software components in isolation.</li>
  <li>Integration testing to identify issues when integrating system parts.</li>
  <li>System testing to verify the entire system‚Äôs performance.</li>
  <li>User acceptance testing to confirm alignment with user needs and requirements.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Synputer project represents a fusion of innovation and sound project management principles. Our choice of Agile-based methodology for software development aligns with industry trends, ensuring adaptability and responsiveness (Kerzner, 2017; Lock, 2019).</p>

<p>Requirements gathering, grounded in stakeholder dialogue and Gherkin specifications, sets the stage for user-centric development (Schwalbe, 2018).</p>

<p>Our project plan, constrained by budget and deadlines, emphasizes resource allocation and efficiency (Phillips &amp; Phillips, 2017).</p>

<p>Testing, a cornerstone of quality assurance, will strike a balance between hardware and software quality. Our pricing strategy and revenue generation plans, included in the appendices, promise long-term success.</p>

<h2 id="appendix-b-pricing-strategy">APPENDIX B: PRICING STRATEGY</h2>
<h3 id="pricing-strategies-and-considerations">Pricing Strategies and Considerations</h3>
<p>The pricing strategy for the Synputer machine is carefully crafted to balance competitiveness and profitability. It considers various factors and considerations:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Production Cost</strong>: Pricing considers the total cost of production, including materials, labour, and overhead. We aim to ensure that the selling price covers these costs while leaving room for profit.</li>
  <li><strong>Market Analysis</strong>: Thorough market research is conducted to understand customer expectations, demand elasticity, and competitive pricing in the computing industry.</li>
  <li><strong>Competitive Positioning</strong>: The Synputer will be positioned competitively within the market. Pricing will be set to offer value to customers while maintaining a competitive edge.</li>
  <li><strong>Segmentation</strong>: Different pricing strategies may be employed for various customer segments. Tailoring pricing to meet the needs of different customer groups is a consideration.</li>
  <li><strong>Promotions and Discounts</strong>: Consideration of promotional pricing and discounts to stimulate initial sales and market penetration.</li>
  <li><strong>Long-term Sustainability</strong>: Pricing is not just for immediate profitability but also for long-term sustainability. It considers the potential for recurring revenue through accessories, software, and support services.</li>
  <li><strong>Price Testing</strong>: Ongoing evaluation and adjustment of pricing strategies based on market feedback and performance.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="appendix-c-revenue-generation">APPENDIX C: REVENUE GENERATION</h2>
