<h1 id="unit-1-introduction-to-software-engineering-project-management">Unit 1: Introduction to Software Engineering Project Management</h1>

<p>Welcome to Week 1. This module covers an emerging multi-disciplinary role, that of the Software Engineering Project Manager.</p>

<p>This week looks at the different disciplines that a Software Engineering Project Manager needs to be familiar with, both traditional project management skills such as resource management, planning and estimating, as well as more technical skills such as requirement management and engineering, agile management and design collaboration.</p>

<p>In this unit we shall:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Explain the differences between traditional project management and software engineering project management (SEPM)</li>
  <li>Justify the need for SEPM.</li>
  <li>Discuss the history of project management and software engineering.</li>
  <li>Describe the tools and certifications commonly used by ALL project managers.</li>
</ul>

<p>On completion of this unit you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Describe a number of large projects, and the reasons for failure.</li>
  <li>Explain the relationship between Project Management, TOGAF and the SDLC.</li>
  <li>Describe the differences between the development of the Software Engineering and Project Management disciplines.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="formative-activities">Formative activities</h2>

<h3 id="team-project">Team Project</h3>
<p>Teamwork is a continuous theme throughout this module with 2 fully assessed submissions required from each team.  You will need to read the Group/Teamwork guidance on the Department website regarding team roles and the scoring of team activities. The scoring system is based on a team score from your tutor and a peer assessment score from each team member using the template available in unit 6 and 11 assignment submission portals. Hence, you will need to ensure continuous engagement in your team activities. If there are any issues, these should be brought to the attention of your tutor as soon as they arise. You can arrange a one-to-one session during tutor office hours or hold discussions during the seminar sessions.
The first live session of the module will be a discussion/ briefing on the assessments for this module. Teams and projects will be assigned, including the websites to be used for the assessments. There is a deadline at the end of this week for the final group contract to be agreed by each team. A copy will need to be emailed to the module tutor. If you cannot attend this session, please get in touch with the module tutor as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="assessment-notes">Assessment Notes</h3>
<p>For this module, teams will be paired up so that each pair form a user group ‚Äì development group partnership. (i.e., each team is the user for the other team, and vice versa).</p>

<p>From a development perspective, each team should select and agree a SDLC methodology they will adopt throughout the assessment as the basis of managing the process, which should accommodate the following stages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Requirements.</li>
  <li>Design.</li>
  <li>Development.</li>
  <li>Test (UAT).</li>
  <li>Delivery/Handover.</li>
  <li>Each team should execute the entire SDLC and there should be a clear plan published, along with regular (minuted) meetings that track progress. The minutes can be held in software like Trello or just in Word or Excel, depending on team preferences.</li>
</ul>

<p>The notes in the Unit 6 Assessment page are guidance you should follow for each phase.</p>

<h3 id="e-portfolio">e-Portfolio</h3>
<p>The e-portfolio is one of the final assessment pieces for this module. If you haven‚Äôt already done so, you will need to create a new section in your e-portfolio specifically for this module. A guideline on the requirements is provided on the ‚ÄúE-Portfolio‚Äù page. If you have any questions about this, please contact the module tutor.</p>

<h3 id="module-wiki">Module Wiki</h3>
<p>As you work through this module, you will inevitably come across terms and pieces of information which are novel and worth sharing. You can place such information in the Module Wiki to benefit the whole group. In the wiki, you can place a term/word/phrase, as well as its definition and/or any information you have sourced on the topic (clearly referenced).</p>
