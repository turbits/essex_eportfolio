<h1 id="unit-7-collaborative-discussion-part-2-summary-post">Unit 7: Collaborative Discussion Part 2: Summary Post</h1>

<p>Reflecting on the discussion around this topic, content errors aside, I found it quite insightful. it‚Äôs clear to me that the CUE model presented by Minge and Thuring in their 2018 article on ‚Äúhedonic and pragmatic effects in early user experience‚Äù needs work. Its lack of clarity and readability compared to the ContinUE model by Pohlmeyer et al., which is more straightforward and comprehensive, would contribute to errors by those using it to understand and plan a user experience.</p>

<p>I appreciate Michael‚Äôs post, outlining the idea that sometimes a UX that is at first glance a joy to use, can turn out to be made overly complex, hindering the user experience and potentially negatively affecting the user and therefore the product‚Äôs usage (Sammueller, 2023). I expanded on this to outline that perhaps the opposite is true, often times I will find myself attempting to perform an action and cannot as the interface is too complex. This is very often the case when it comes to things like Exchange Server management, among other extremely complex softwares. There is often simply no way to easily perform an action without opening a PowerShell instance and running esoteric commands.</p>

<p>The mention of high-profile game releases like Battlefield 2042, which over-hyped and under-delivered, are a stark reminder of the importance of managing user expectations and delivering on what the user perceives will be their experience with a product.</p>

<p>In conclusion, this discussion has provided some valuable insight into the complexities of user experience and satisfaction, and the pivotal role that a clear and comprehensive UX model plays in the development of a product. It is a reminder that successful UX design is a combination of thoughtful planning, clear representation, and responsiveness to user needs.</p>
