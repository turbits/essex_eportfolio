<h1 id="unit-6-assignment-2-presentation-description">Unit 6: Assignment 2: Presentation Description</h1>

<p>In this unit, the focus is on the second objective/deliverable, the team presentation. This assignment has two component parts, the team submission, and your individual peer assessment. All components must be submitted by end of unit 11. This accounts for 40% of your final module mark. <strong>Only one submission is required from each team. Nominate one member of your team to submit on the team‚Äôs behalf.</strong></p>

<h2 id="assignment-brief">Assignment Brief</h2>
<p>Carrying on from the Full Brief provided in Unit 6, this assignment focuses on the second deliverable, a presentation of your response to the EDC challenges (<a href="https://www.my-course.co.uk/pluginfile.php/1031607/mod_assign/intro/2.%20SEPM%202023%20Case%20Study.pdf">see part 2, chapter 5 of the case study</a> and <a href="https://www.my-course.co.uk/pluginfile.php/1031607/mod_assign/intro/3.%20Appendix%201%20HW%20BOM%20SEPMv2.xlsx">Appendix 1</a> and <a href="https://www.my-course.co.uk/pluginfile.php/1031607/mod_assign/intro/4.%20Appendix%202%20SW%20BOM%20SEPMv2.xlsx">2</a>).</p>

<p>This submission should consist of a presentation to the major stakeholders that consists of a status/progress update, a demonstration of the demo model/simulation and a plan and budget showing how the product will progress from design through to implementation and ultimately UAT.</p>

<h2 id="presentation">Presentation</h2>
<p>The presentation should consist of a PowerPoint deck of up to 10 slides that describes the project milestones, summarises plans and sprints, covers the status of the project and contains a plan (and budget) to get to final implementation.</p>

<p>Please ensure that your citations and list of references are included in the slides and citations mentioned in your transcript.</p>

<h2 id="demonstration">Demonstration</h2>
<p>You will need to build an application as described below. As a team, you should also be prepared to give a demonstration of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Code and executables;</li>
  <li>Testing; and</li>
  <li>The functionality of the application that will be submitted, demonstrating as much functionality as possible and drawing attention to key operations and code.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a reminder, the programming language to be used is Python as this is more inclusive for your team (see the department page on Teamwork).</p>

<h2 id="checklist">Checklist</h2>
<p>Each deliverable for this assessment is mentioned below and is equally distributed across 3 grading criteria (see Module Resources for the full list):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a table that lists the updated requirements that will be met by the modified systems, with justifications for why they were selected. State the assumptions you need to make to be able to design the project plan. (Knowledge and Understanding, 25%)</li>
  <li>Create a fully costed project plan for the updated system you have designed - this plan should detail the components and cost price of a modified system and when the new prototypes will be ready. Bear in mind that marketing department have already advertised systems at the price of ¬£399.99. Discuss whether you will make two systems (one for Synful, one for EDC, or have one system used by both companies but sold under different names/badges. How will you accommodate the different requirements from EDC, existing users and potential new users?) (Knowledge and Understanding, 25%)</li>
  <li>Create and deliver a Presentation that addresses EDC‚Äôs complaints and explains how they will be mitigated ‚Äì including explaining when the new systems will be available, what they will cost and any deviations from expectations (Knowledge and Understanding, 25% and Criticality, 25%).</li>
  <li>Create a python application that can be used for cost estimation. It should include copious comments and be supplied with a readme file that details how it is installed/ executed, the decisions around which estimating mechanism was used, and references to any academic sources and/ or algorithms that were utilised. (Knowledge and Understanding, 25% and Criticality, 25%)</li>
  <li>Ensure that you produce a business ready proposal, that is well structured with no typographical errors. It should present your recommendations in a clear and easy to read format. It should have been proofread before it is submitted (Structure and Presentation, 10%)</li>
  <li>Finally, ensure your justifications for any decisions made are based on good academic principles and that any academic sources you have used/referred to are clearly cited and that your references are presented in the required UoEO format.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>For this assignment, you are required to record a 20-minute presentation, along with a transcript of the audio file. The presentation should include your demonstration. Your slides should not be wordy or repeat, verbatim, the oral presentation. Visuals, illustration, statistics, charts, tables and indication of key pointers are welcome. In assessing the presentation for marking, emphasis will be place on the oral content. However, clarity of the visual presentation will also be taken into account.</p>

<p>It is strongly recommended that, in order to record your presentation, you use a headset with a microphone.</p>

<p>There is no word count for the slide presentation, and there is no fixed word count for the oral presentation/transcript. However, note that an average speech rate for a comfortable and clearly orally paced presentation is about 100-150 words per minute. Given that your presentation should be about 20 minutes, you can work against a minimum of 2,000 to a maximum of 2,500 words in your oral presentation/transcript.</p>

<p>Please Note: Appendices should not be used to extend the core report as reports should stand alone, complete and concise, without the appendices. They should really only be used if required, and only for supplementary and/ or supporting information. One key part of the exercises in this module is the need to be to be able to express ideas succinctly, concisely and with necessary brevity.</p>

<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>Design, develop and evaluate management systems to produce solutions that handle constraints and uncertainty, contextualising BDD concepts and secure coding principles &amp; practices in SDLC.
Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real-life perspectives on roles and team organisation.</p>

<h2 id="turnitin-originality-check">Turnitin Originality Check</h2>
<p>Before submitting your assignment, it is important to check the originality of your work by submitting your assignment to Turnitin.</p>

<p>By submitting your assignment to this tool you will receive an originality report which can be used to check that you have not included other authors work without correct citation. It is important to note that submitting your work to the Turnitin Originality Check tool does not count as a submission of your final work. You must still submit your assignment below.</p>

<h2 id="academic-integrity-and-plagiarism">Academic Integrity and Plagiarism</h2>
<p>We take academic integrity very seriously. Academic integrity means acting with fairness and honesty, giving credit to others where you are referring to their ideas or research and respecting the work of others. Plagiarism is defined as: ‚ÄòUsing or copying the work of others (whether written, printed or in any other form) without proper acknowledgement‚Äô. Before you finalise your assignment take time to check that all your statements are backed up with supporting evidence, that all sources you use - whether referring to their ideas, quoting directly or paraphrasing - are correctly referenced in the text. Correct use of referencing acknowledges the academic whose work has informed yours, enables the reader to find the sources you have used and demonstrates your ability to find and analyse relevant information.</p>

<p>Failure to properly acknowledge the work of others is an academic offence and may result in your work incurring a penalty or, in the most serious cases, you being removed from the course for academic dishonesty.</p>

<p>If you are unsure about referencing or plagiarism there are useful resources available in the Study Skills Hub which is accessible from the menu on the left hand side. If you are still experiencing difficulties with academic integrity then you can contact the Study Skills Team for individualised support.</p>
